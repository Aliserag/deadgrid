      "background": "Former parkour instructor and amateur urban explorer. Eliot spent his free time mapping out drainage tunnels and abandoned buildings, skills that became invaluable when the world fell apart.",
      "appearance": "Lean and wiry with sun-bleached brown hair tied back in a messy knot. His arms are covered in scrapes and fading bruises from constant movement.",
      "personality": "Restless and observant, with a dark sense of humor that borders on inappropriate. He masks his fear with bravado but has surprising moments of quiet intensity when assessing threats.",

      "backstory": "Eliot was teaching a parkour workshop when the first outbreaks hit. He led his students to relative safety in the storm drain network he'd mapped, but they've all either died or moved on. Now he moves like a ghost through the city's underbelly, using his knowledge of forgotten spaces to avoid both the infected and hostile survivor groups. He's developed a reputation as 'the kid who knows all the back ways' - which brings both opportunities and dangers.",
