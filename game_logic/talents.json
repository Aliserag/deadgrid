      "severity": 7,
      "description": "The survivor begins to hear faint whispers and fragmented thoughts from nearby infected, as if their mind is tuning into a grotesque hive consciousness. These echoes are disjointed and overwhelming, often drowning out their own thoughts.",
      "appearance": "The survivor's eyes develop a faint, pulsating glow, and their veins occasionally shimmer with bioluminescent traces when the whispers grow louder.",
      "benefits": [
        "Can sometimes sense the presence of infected before they are visible",
        "May pick up on the general direction of large hordes"
      ],
      "disadvantages": [
        "Frequent confusion and difficulty concentrating due to the invasive whispers",
        "Risk of paranoia or mistaking real voices for the hive's echoes",
        "Increased stress and mental fatigue"
      ],
      "progression": "Over time, the whispers grow louder and more coherent, potentially leading to full auditory hallucinations or even temporary loss of self-identity as the hive's thoughts dominate.",
      "treatment": "Psychoactive suppressants can temporarily mute the whispers, but prolonged exposure to the fungal groves may worsen the condition. Complete isolation from infected areas might slow progression.",

      "description": "You've learned to distinguish the subtle patterns in the whispers of the infected hivemind. The constant murmurs that drive others mad now provide you with early warnings of nearby threats. Your mind has adapted to filter the noise into useful information.",
