      "severity": 7,
      "description": "The survivor begins to hear faint whispers and fragmented thoughts from nearby infected, as if their mind is tuning into a grotesque hive consciousness. These echoes are disjointed and overwhelming, often drowning out their own thoughts.",

      "progression": "Over time, the whispers grow louder and more coherent, potentially leading to full auditory hallucinations or even temporary loss of self-identity as the hive's thoughts dominate.",
      "treatment": "Psychoactive suppressants can temporarily mute the whispers, but prolonged exposure to the fungal groves may worsen the condition. Complete isolation from infected areas might slow progression.",
