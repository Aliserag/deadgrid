      "type": "mental",
      "severity": 7,
      "description": "The survivor begins to hear faint whispers and fragmented thoughts from nearby infected, as if their mind is tuning into a grotesque hive consciousness. These echoes are disjointed and overwhelming, often drowning out their own thoughts.",
      "appearance": "The survivor's eyes develop a faint, pulsating glow, and their veins occasionally shimmer with bioluminescent traces when the whispers grow louder.",
      "benefits": [
        "Can sometimes sense the presence of infected before they are visible",
        "May pick up on the general direction of large hordes"
      ],
      "disadvantages": [
        "Frequent confusion and difficulty concentrating due to the invasive whispers",
        "Risk of paranoia or mistaking real voices for the hive's echoes",
        "Increased stress and mental fatigue"
      ],
      "progression": "Over time, the whispers grow louder and more coherent, potentially leading to full auditory hallucinations or even temporary loss of self-identity as the hive's thoughts dominate.",
      "treatment": "Psychoactive suppressants can temporarily mute the whispers, but prolonged exposure to the fungal groves may worsen the condition. Complete isolation from infected areas might slow progression.",
