# The Forgotten Tunnels

A sprawling underground network of subway tunnels and stations, now overgrown with strange fungi and littered with abandoned trains. The air is thick with the smell of damp concrete and decay. Flickering emergency lights cast eerie shadows, and the distant sound of dripping water echoes through the tunnels. Survivors whisper of something moving in the deeper, unexplored sections.
