# DeadGrid

A procedurally generated web3 zombie apocalypse survival simulation that uses VRF. Each day reveals a new log entry from a lone survivor in a decaying city overrun by the undead. Every night players can make decisions about their camp, survivors, collect gear and have serious consequences or opportunities for the decisions they make. 

## Structure

- `/logs` - Daily survivor logs
- `/survivors` - Character info and inventory
- `/city` - Map of the decaying urban environment
- `/game_logic` - Rules and mechanics that drive the simulation
