      "title": "The Last Harvest",
      "protagonist": {
          "name": "Elara Vance",
          "age": 34,
          "backstory": "Former agricultural scientist who survived the initial collapse by fortifying her university's experimental greenhouse. Lost her family to the early riots and now suffers from survivor's guilt, channeling all her energy into preserving plant knowledge."
      },
      "setting": "The ruins of Cornell University's agricultural campus, 12 years after the Collapse. Late autumn with early frost threatening the last viable greenhouse.",
      "situation": "Elara's carefully maintained greenhouse—the last repository of non-GMO seeds in the region—is failing. The solar batteries that power the climate control are dying, and unseasonable frost threatens to kill everything. She has three days to harvest the remaining viable seeds before the plants freeze. The surrounding area is plagued by raiders who've been getting closer to her location, drawn by rumors of 'living plants.' Her isolation has kept her safe but now works against her.",
      "attempted_solution": "Elara decided to risk one final massive harvest, working day and night to collect and dry seeds. She rationed the remaining battery power for the drying racks and seed preservation systems. Knowing she needed help, she used her emergency radio to contact a nearby settlement she'd occasionally traded with, offering half the seed bank in exchange for manual labor and protection during the critical harvest window. Two volunteers from the settlement arrived—Marcus, an experienced farmer, and Lena, his daughter.",
      "complications": "The raiders had been monitoring radio traffic and intercepted her transmission. They attacked just as the first frost began forming on the greenhouse panels. Marcus was shot defending the entrance while Elara and Lena desperately tried to save the most critical seed varieties. The raiders started fires, damaging the greenhouse structure and destroying already harvested seeds. In the chaos, the remaining battery power failed completely, leaving the temperature control systems dead as temperatures plummeted below freezing.",
      "resolution": "Elara made the agonizing choice to sacrifice the northern greenhouse section—the least viable plants—by setting counter-fires to create smoke cover. While the raiders were distracted, she and Lena escaped through a collapsed tunnel with only 40% of the seed bank saved. They barely made it to the settlement, pursued until the raiders were driven off by the settlement's guards. The greenhouse—Elara's home and life's work for twelve years—burned to the ground behind them.",
      "lesson_learned": "Sometimes preservation requires destruction. Hoarding knowledge alone is worthless—it must be shared and protected by community. Isolation creates vulnerability, not security.",
      "casualties": [
          "Marcus (settlement volunteer)",
          "The entire northern seed bank collection",
          "The greenhouse ecosystem (irreplaceable research specimens)"
      ],
      "resources_gained": [
          "40% of original seed bank",
          "Community trust with the settlement",
          "Two raider rifles and ammunition",
          "Detailed maps of raider territory from captured supplies"
      ],
      "moral_choice": "Whether to destroy part of the seed bank to save the rest, knowing some unique genetic lines would be lost forever, and whether to sacrifice Marcus's defense position to create the diversion needed for escape.",
      "long_term_impact": "Elara becomes the settlement's head agriculturist, transforming their food security. The saved seeds lead to sustainable crop rotation. The raiders, now aware of the settlement's resources, begin planning larger attacks. Marcus's death creates tension between Elara and some settlement members who blame her for his loss. The loss of certain plant varieties means some traditional medicines and crops are gone forever."
