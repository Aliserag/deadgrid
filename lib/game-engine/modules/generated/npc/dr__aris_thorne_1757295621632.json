  "backstory": "Dr. Thorne was working on radiation-resistant crops when the bombs fell. She survived in her sealed laboratory for months before emerging to find the world changed. She founded The Greenthumb Collective with other survivors who believe that restoring plant life is key to humanity's survival. Her work has led to several stable mutant crop varieties, though she keeps her most promising discoveries secret until she can ensure they won't be weaponized."
