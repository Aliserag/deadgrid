  "backstory": "Before the collapse, Dr. Thorne worked on developing drought-resistant crops. When society fell, he used his knowledge to help found the Greenthumb Collectiveâ€”a group dedicated to preserving botanical knowledge and creating sustainable food sources. He carries guilt over a failed experiment that may have contributed to one of the more aggressive mutated plant species now roaming the wastes."
