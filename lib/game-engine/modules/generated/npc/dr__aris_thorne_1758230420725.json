  "backstory": "Before the collapse, Dr. Thorne worked on developing drought-resistant crops for arid regions. When society fell, she used her knowledge to help survivors identify edible plants and avoid poisonous mutations. She founded the Greenthumb Collectiveâ€”a network of botanists, farmers, and foragers dedicated to preserving agricultural knowledge and developing sustainable food sources in the wasteland. She carries guilt over not being able to save her original research team, who perished during the initial chaos, and now dedicates her life to ensuring no one starves due to ignorance of the land."
