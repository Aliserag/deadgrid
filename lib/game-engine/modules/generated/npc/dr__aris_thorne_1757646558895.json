  "backstory": "Before the collapse, Dr. Thorne worked on developing drought-resistant crops for arid regions. When society fell, he used his knowledge to establish the Verdant Covenantâ€”a group dedicated to restoring agriculture and combating mutated plant life. He believes that the key to humanity's survival lies not in scavenging the old world, but in cultivating a new one, though his methods sometimes border on reckless experimentation."
