    "Former pre-war data archive with partially functional terminals",
    "Giant rusted dome that amplifies sound dangerously",

  "exploration_notes": "Players will find decaying server racks with recoverable data fragments, automated defense systems that still activate, and strange mutations among the Rust-Eaters that suggest chemical exposure. The upper levels are unstable but contain valuable pre-war blueprints, while the lower levels require hazmat gear due to toxic leakage."
