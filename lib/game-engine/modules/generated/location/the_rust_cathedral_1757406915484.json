  "exploration_notes": "Players will find valuable pre-war tech components, encrypted data drives, and rare chemicals in preserved labs. The upper levels are relatively safe but poorly lit, while the lower sub-levels contain aggressive mutants and environmental hazards. Strange electromagnetic phenomena interfere with electronics throughout the structure."
