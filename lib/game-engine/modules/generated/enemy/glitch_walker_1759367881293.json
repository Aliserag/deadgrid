  "description": "A corrupted pre-war security automaton that moves with unsettling, jerky motions. Its metallic frame is rusted and scarred from decades of exposure, with flickering red optic sensors that glow ominously in the dark. Wires dangle from its joints, sparking occasionally, and its movements are accompanied by the whirring of strained servos and distorted audio fragments of its original programming."
