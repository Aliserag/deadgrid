  "description": "A quadrupedal robotic unit with a corroded metal frame and exposed wiring. Its single red photoreceptor scans erratically, and its movements are accompanied by the whir of strained servos and the clank of loose components. Originally a pre-war security drone, it now prowls ruined urban zones, hunting anything with a power signature."
