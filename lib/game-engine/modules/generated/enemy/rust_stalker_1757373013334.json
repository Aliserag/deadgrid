  "description": "A pre-war security automaton repurposed by scavengers, now roaming the wastes autonomously. It stands 7 feet tall with a rust-pitted metallic frame, multiple red optical sensors, and a retractable electro-lash whip extending from its right arm. Moves with unnerving silence despite its size, often concealing itself in shadows or debris before striking."
