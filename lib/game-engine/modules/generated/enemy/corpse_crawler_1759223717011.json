  "description": "A humanoid creature that moves on all fours with disturbing grace. Its pale, hairless skin is stretched taut over an emaciated frame, and its limbs are elongated with claw-like digits. The most unsettling feature is its jaw - unhinged and filled with needle-like teeth, capable of distending to unnatural proportions. They emit low, guttural clicking sounds when hunting and often drag their bellies along the ground, leaving faint trails in the dust."
