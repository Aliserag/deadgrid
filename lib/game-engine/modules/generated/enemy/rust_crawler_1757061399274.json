  "description": "A spider-like autonomous security drone, roughly the size of a large dog, with rusted metal plating and exposed wiring. Its central optic sensor glows with a faint red light, and it moves with unnerving precision on six jointed legs. Often found lurking in shadowy corners of ruined facilities before initiating ambushes."
