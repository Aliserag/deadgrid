  "description": "A pre-war security drone, now corroded and malfunctioning. Its once-sleek chrome frame is pitted with rust and scorch marks, with one optical sensor flickering erratically. Moves with jerky, uneven motions, emitting a low hum interspersed with static bursts. Often found lurking in shadows of ruined buildings before engaging."
