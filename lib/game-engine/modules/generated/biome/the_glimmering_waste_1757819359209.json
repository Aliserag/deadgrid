  "name": "The Glimmering Waste",
  "description": "A vast expanse of crystalline formations that grew from chemical spills and mutated flora after the collapse. The jagged structures refract light in disorienting patterns, creating mirages and hidden dangers. Survivors tread carefully here, as the very ground can shift without warning.",

  "hazards": [
    "Light refraction mirages",
    "Fragile crystalline structures that collapse under weight",

  "entry_message": "The air shimmers with unnatural light as you step into the Glimmering Waste. Jagged crystal formations tower around you, casting rainbow prisms across the barren landscape. Every step echoes with the sound of fragile structures waiting to give way."
