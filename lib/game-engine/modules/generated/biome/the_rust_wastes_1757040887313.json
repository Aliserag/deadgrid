  "name": "The Rust-Wastes",
  "description": "A vast expanse of corroded metal and industrial decay where the ruins of ancient factories merge with the earth. Toxic pools of chemical sludge bubble between jagged metal formations, and the air carries the permanent scent of ozone and rust. Strange crystalline growths have begun to consume the decaying structures, creating an eerie landscape of industrial and biological fusion.",
