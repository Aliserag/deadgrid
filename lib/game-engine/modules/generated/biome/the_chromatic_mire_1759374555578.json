  "entry_message": "The air grows thick with the scent of ozone and chemicals. Before you stretches a landscape of impossible beauty - shimmering pools of rainbow-colored liquids glow beneath twisted crystalline spires that pierce the hazy sky. Every surface seems to pulse with faint light, and a low hum vibrates through the ground beneath your feet."
