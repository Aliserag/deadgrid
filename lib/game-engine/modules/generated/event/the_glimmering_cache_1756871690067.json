  "trigger_condition": "After resting in a ruined building for at least 6 hours",
  "description": "A faint, rhythmic humming awakens you. A soft blue light pulses from a crack in the floorboards, revealing a hidden, pre-war storage container. It seems intact, but the hum suggests its power source is still active, and possibly unstable.",
  "choices": [
    {
      "option": "Force the container open with a crowbar.",
      "consequence": "Gain 3-5 random high-quality supplies (meds, ammo, tech parts), but the unstable power core ruptures, dealing 15 damage to you and attracting nearby Scavengers."
    },
    {
      "option": "Attempt to carefully disarm the power source first.",
      "consequence": "Requires a Tech skill check (moderate). Success: Safely retrieve all contents (5-7 supplies) and a unique energy cell. Failure: The core overloads, destroying the loot and dealing 10 damage."
    },
    {
      "option": "Ignore it and leave immediately.",
      "consequence": "Avoid all risk. The humming fades after you depart. Gain nothing, but also avoid danger."
    }
  ],
  "rarity": "uncommon",
  "duration": "Until the container is opened or you leave the area"
