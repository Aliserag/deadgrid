You've stumbled upon a hidden cache of pre-Collapse supplies—canned food, clean water, and medical kits—all neatly organized. However, the cache is rigged with a crude but effective alarm system. Tripping a nearly invisible wire sets off a loud, piercing siren that echoes through the empty district. In the distance, you hear answering shouts and the sound of hurried footsteps approaching. Someone else was guarding this stash, and they're coming fast.",
