  "trigger_condition": "Player enters a ruined radio station or activates a functioning ham radio",
  "description": "A faint, looping signal cuts through the staticâ€”a pre-recorded voice repeating coordinates and a plea for survivors to gather. The signal is weak and fading, suggesting it's been transmitting for years. Could this be a genuine safe haven, or a trap set by raiders?",

    {
      "option": "Follow the coordinates",

    {
      "option": "Attempt to trace the signal source",
      "consequence": "Discover the broadcast originates from an automated system in a decaying military outpost, yielding tech scraps but alerting nearby feral ghouls."
    },
    {
      "option": "Ignore and jam the signal",
      "consequence": "Avoid potential danger but lose the opportunity for rare loot; gain temporary reputation with local isolationist factions."
