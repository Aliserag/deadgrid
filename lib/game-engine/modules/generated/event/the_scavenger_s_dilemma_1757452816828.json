  "description": "You stumble upon a flickering light coming from a half-collapsed warehouse. Inside, you find a lone scavenger desperately trying to pry open a reinforced storage container. They notice you and nervously offer a deal: help them open it, and you can take your pick of the contentsâ€”but they get first choice.",
  "choices": [
    {
      "option": "Agree to help and split the loot",
      "consequence": "Gain a random rare item, but lose 15 Stamina from the effort."
    },
    {
      "option": "Threaten the scavenger and take everything",
      "consequence": "Gain all items from the container, but suffer a -10 Reputation with nearby factions."
    },
    {
      "option": "Ignore the scavenger and leave the area",
      "consequence": "No gains or losses, but the opportunity is lost."
    },
    {
      "option": "Attempt to open the container alone after scaring the scavenger off",
      "consequence": "50% chance to gain all items, 50% chance to trigger a trap, losing 20 Health."
