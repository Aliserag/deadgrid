  "description": "Before the Fall, the Central Data Repository was humanity's greatest store of knowledge. Now it lies in ruins, picked over by scavengers and claimed by mutated creatures. Keeper Aris believes a specific terminal may still contain pre-collapse agricultural data that could revolutionize settlement farming. But reaching it requires navigating treacherous ruins and dealing with the current 'occupants'.",
  "objectives": [
    "Locate the Central Data Repository entrance in the Old District",
    "Clear the main atrium of Festering Crawlers",
    "Restore power to the archive wing using spare fusion cells",
    "Retrieve the agricultural data from Terminal Gamma-7",
    "Return to Keeper Aris with the data crystal"

    "initial": "You look capable. Most who venture into the Repository don't return. But if you succeed, what you'll bring back could feed generations. Interested in making history?",
    "accept": "Excellent. The entrance is sealed behind a security door - you'll need to bypass it. And watch for the Crawlers - they nest in dark places and attack in swarms.",
    "decline": "I understand. It's not for everyone. Come back if you change your mind - the data won't retrieve itself.",
    "completion": "You actually did it! This data... it's more complete than I dreamed. The settlement will eat well thanks to you. Take these supplies - you've earned them."
