  "title": "Radio Silence",
  "giver": "Old Man Jenkins",
  "description": "The settlement's primary radio receiver has gone silent, cutting off vital communications with other survivor groups. Old Man Jenkins, the settlement's makeshift engineer, believes the antenna array on the nearby transmission tower has been damaged, possibly by recent storms or scavengers. He needs someone brave enough to venture out and repair it before the settlement becomes completely isolated.",
  "objectives": [
    "Travel to the Rustpeak Transmission Tower",
    "Clear the tower base of any hostiles",
    "Climb to the antenna array (150m elevation)",
    "Repair the damaged antenna components using the repair kit",
    "Restore power to the transmitter by resetting the breakers",
    "Return to Old Man Jenkins with confirmation of success"

      "The antenna array at Rustpeak Tower has gone silent. Without it, we can't reach the other settlements.",

      "You did it! The static is gone - clear signals coming through!",
