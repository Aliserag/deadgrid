  "description": "Old Man Jenkins, the settlement's resident tinkerer, believes he can restore long-range communications if someone can retrieve a specific radio component from the abandoned transmission tower on the northern ridge. The tower was overrun during the collapse, but Jenkins insists the part he needs should still be intact deep within the facility.",

    "Locate the Central Control Room",
    "Retrieve the High-Frequency Modulator from the equipment rack",
