  "description": "Forged from the hull of a pre-Collapse warship and sharpened on irradiated stone, this massive cleaver was the signature weapon of the Rust-Eater clanâ€”scavengers who believed metal should 'bleed' like flesh. Its jagged, corroded edge is notorious for leaving wounds that never fully heal.",
  "special_effects": "Inflicts 'Festering Wound' on hit: targets bleed for 3 damage per second for 10 seconds and receive 20% more damage from acid and corrosion attacks while bleeding."
