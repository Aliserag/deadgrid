  "description": "Forged from the irradiated spine of a mutated serpent and wrapped in conductive salvaged wiring, this whip crackles with residual energy. It is said to have been crafted by a lone scavenger who dwelled in the metallic ruins of the Old World's factories, using the ambient radiation to temper the spine into a deadly weapon. The name comes from the eerie singing sound it produces when swung through the air, a mournful melody that echoes the despair of the wastes.",
  "special_effects": "On hit, has a 25% chance to apply 'Corrosive Decay,' reducing the target's armor by 15% for 10 seconds. Glows faintly in the presence of radiation sources."
