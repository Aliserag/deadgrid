  "description": "Forged from the hull of a pre-Collapse naval vessel, this massive cleaver bears deep corrosion patterns that somehow enhance its cutting edge. The weapon was reportedly crafted by the legendary scavenger known only as 'Rust-Eater,' who claimed the sea itself taught him how to shape decay into strength. The faint scent of saltwater and ozone still clings to the metal.",
