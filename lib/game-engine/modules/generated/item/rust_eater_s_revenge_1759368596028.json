  "description": "Forged from the remains of a pre-Collapse industrial shredder, this massive blade bears deep grooves where its teeth once spun. The metal has been reforged with scavenged titanium alloys, giving it an unsettling gray-purple sheen. Legends say the original machine consumed entire buildings during the Resource Wars, and some survivors claim the blade still hums with that destructive hunger.",
