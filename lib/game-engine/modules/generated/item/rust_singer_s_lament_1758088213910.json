  "description": "Forged from the hull of a pre-Collapse naval vessel, this massive axe hums with a low, resonant frequency when swung. The blade is etched with tidal patterns that seem to shift in certain lights, and the haft is wrapped in salt-cured leather that never seems to wear down. Survivors whisper that it was crafted by a lonely smith who listened too long to the corroding songs of the sea.",
  "special_effects": "On hit, has a 25% chance to inflict 'Corroded' status on target, reducing their armor by 20% for 10 seconds. The humming sound attracts nearby Scrap-Scuttlers but repels larger predators."
