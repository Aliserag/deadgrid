      "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 6). Was preparing for a research expedition to the Great Barrier Reef when the outbreak began. Dreamed of discovering new marine species and writing a book about ocean conservation.",
      "day_number": 327,
      "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Northern California coast. The structure leans precariously against granite cliffs, its white paint peeling like sunburned skin. Salt spray constantly mists the windows, and the groan of the damaged lighthouse mechanism provides a mournful soundtrack to existence.",
      "entry": "The rain hasn't stopped for three days. It drums against the rusted roof in a rhythm that's become the heartbeat of my despair. Today I found myself talking to the gulls again—naming them after my colleagues from the university. Professor Henderson squawked back at me from the rocks below, his feathers matted with the same grime that coats my soul.\n\nI almost didn't make it back from the tidal pools today. The waves came up faster than anticipated, hungry gray hands trying to claim me. As I scrambled up the slick rocks, my mind flashed to Lena's laughter on that beach in Maui, how she'd squealed when a wave caught her by surprise. The memory was so vivid I could almost taste the pineapple we'd shared afterward.\n\nFound a sealed plastic container washed up near the cave—inside were photographs of another family. Their smiling faces undamaged by the world's ending. I should have left them there. Their perfection feels like an accusation. What right do I have to survive when my own family's photos are buried under rubble back in Oakland?\n\nSometimes I wonder if I'm becoming more lighthouse than man—just another broken structure warning others away from dangerous shores. The light hasn't worked since day 47, but I keep climbing the spiral stairs each evening anyway. Maybe tomorrow I'll see a ship. Maybe tomorrow.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (down 40 lbs), saltwater sores on hands and legs, chronic cough from damp conditions. Mentally: Severe depression with moments of lucidity, talks to animals and inanimate objects, experiences vivid flashbacks to pre-outbreak life, sleeps only 3-4 hours per night.",
      "discoveries": "The tidal patterns have shifted dramatically—low tide reveals previously submerged caves containing strange, phosphorescent fungi that grow on damp rock. These fungi glow brighter when the 'Shamblers' are near, possibly detecting some chemical or frequency humans cannot perceive. Also confirmed saltwater contamination makes fresh water sources within 100 yards of shore unsafe without triple distillation.",
      "warnings": "Never trust the silence between waves—the infected have learned to move during these moments. Boiling seawater alone isn't enough—must use sand filtration and solar stills to remove new contaminants. The glowing fungi are reliable early warning systems but cause hallucinations if ingested. Trust the gulls—they stop calling when danger approaches shore.",
      "last_meal": "Steamed mussels with dandelion greens (11 hours ago), collected during low tide. Ate half and saved the rest wrapped in kelp for tomorrow.",
      "companions": "Alone since day 89 when Elias succumbed to infected wounds. Lost wife and daughters during initial Oakland evacuation chaos. Occasionally trades with a silent fisherman who rows past every full moon—we exchange mussels for rainwater using a bucket and rope system without ever speaking or seeing each other clearly.",
