  "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Elena with two daughters, Sofia (8) and Maya (6). Was preparing for a research expedition to the Great Barrier Reef when the outbreak began. Dreamed of publishing groundbreaking research on coral adaptation to climate change.",
  "day_number": 187,
  "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Northern California coast. The structure groans with each gust of wind off the Pacific, salt crusting every window. The rotating light above still functions somehow, casting periodic beams through fractured glass.",
  "entry": "The rain hasn't stopped for three days. It drums against the tin roof in a rhythm that feels both comforting and maddening. I found myself talking to Elena again today—full conversations as if she were sitting across from me at this damp wooden table. The madness of grief or the sanity of preservation? I can't tell anymore.\n\nToday I had to make a choice that would have shattered the man I was before. A family—mother, father, young boy—came stumbling up the coastal path. They'd been bitten. All of them. The boy's arm was wrapped in bloody rags, his eyes already glazing over. They begged for shelter, for medicine that doesn't exist anymore.\n\nI stood there with my rifle, the cold metal biting into my palm. Elena's voice in my head whispered 'mercy,' while every survival instinct screamed 'danger.' In the end, I turned them away. Watched them stumble back into the rain, three doomed figures disappearing into the gray curtain.\n\nThe worst part? I calculated their direction—north, away from my position—and felt relief. What kind of man finds relief in directing death away from himself? I used to teach students about the interconnectedness of life, about compassion. Now I measure worth in calories and security.\n\nWhen the beam from the lighthouse passes through the window, I can almost see my daughters' faces in the brief illumination. Sofia would be nine now. Maya seven. Their birthdays came and went while I was hiding in this stone tower, counting cans of beans.\n\nThe rain is slowing. I can hear the waves again—that eternal crashing that outlasts everything human.",
  "condition": "Physically malnourished (15 lbs underweight), saltwater sores on hands and lips, chronic cough from damp conditions. Mentally: experiencing auditory hallucinations of deceased family, severe moral fatigue, oscillating between lucid planning and dissociative episodes.",
  "discoveries": "Saltwater can preserve meat almost as well as smoking when combined with certain coastal herbs. The infected avoid areas with strong saltwater spray—something about the salinity disrupts their sense of smell. Found that writing daily, even when it feels pointless, maintains cognitive function.",
  "warnings": "Coastal fog masks the moans of the infected until they're dangerously close. Never trust seafood from stagnant tidal pools—the red tide contamination persists. Keep all food in sealed containers—the gulls will tear through anything. The infected are more aggressive during stormy weather.",
  "last_meal": "Boiled dulse seaweed and half a can of kidney beans (8 hours ago), collected three mussels from the rocks for tomorrow",
  "companions": "Alone. Lost wife Elena and daughters Sofia & Maya during evacuation day 3. Traveled with medic Ben Carter for 142 days—he sacrificed himself to draw infected away from our position during a supply run.",
  "hope_level": 3
