      "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 6). Was writing a book about symbiotic relationships in marine life and dreamed of leading conservation efforts in the Great Barrier Reef.",
      "day_number": 327,
      "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Northern California coast. Salt-crusted windows, peeling blue paint, the constant groan of wind through fissures in the stone. The smell of damp wool, wood smoke, and the iron tang of the sea.",
      "entry": "Day 327. The storm finally broke at dawn. I watched the grey waves recede like a defeated army, leaving behind their wreckage on the shore. It was in that tangled mess of kelp and splintered timber that I saw her. A little girl, no older than Maya, clinging to a floating door. She wasn't moving. My first instinct, the old one, the father one, screamed at me to run down there, to scoop her up, to try. Then the new instinct, the survivor one, hissed caution. A trap? Sickness? Another mouth to feed when I can barely feed myself? I stood at the window for what felt like an eternity, my knuckles white on the sill, these two versions of me tearing each other apart. I finally went down. She was ice-cold, but there was a pulse, faint as a moth's wing against my finger. I carried her back up here, wrapped her in every blanket I have, and spent the day trying to get warm broth into her. She hasn't spoken a word. Just stares with huge, hollow eyes that have seen things no child should. I sang to her. The same lullaby I sang to my girls. My voice was a rusty hinge, but her eyes eventually closed. I saved a life today. But the cost of that life, the responsibility of it... God, it's a heavier weight than any I've carried yet. I did it for her. But a selfish part of me knows I also did it for myself. To remember what it feels like to protect something, instead of just hiding from everything.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished, with a persistent cough from the damp and a healing gash on his forearm from a fall last week. Mentally: Weary and emotionally frayed, haunted by memories of his family. The decision to rescue the girl has created a new, acute anxiety but also a fragile sense of purpose.",
      "discoveries": "Realized that preserving his own humanity is as crucial to survival as preserving his body. The act of saving another, even at great personal risk, can be a necessary nutrient for the soul in a world that starves it.",
      "warnings": "Coastal storms can churn up and deposit contaminated materials from further out to sea. Always boil seawater twice if desperate, and be wary of anything that washes ashoreâ€”it could be a resource, a trap, or a carrier of the blight.",
      "last_meal": "A thin, salty stew of boiled mussels, dandelion greens, and a precious quarter of a canned potato, eaten roughly 6 hours ago.",
      "companions": "Previously alone. Now with an unnamed, traumatized young girl he rescued from the shore. His wife and daughters were lost in the initial evacuation chaos.",
      "hope_level": 4
