      "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena for 12 years with a daughter, Maya (8). Was researching thermal resistance in Great Barrier Reef corals when the outbreak began. Dreamed of establishing marine conservation programs in developing nations.",
      "day_number": 187,
      "location": "Abandoned aquarium research facility, coastal Oregon. The main observation deck overlooks what was once a thriving kelp forest exhibit, now a murky tomb of decaying sea life. Salt-crusted windows rattle with each ocean gust, and the air carries the permanent scent of brine and rot.",
      "entry": "Day 187. The generators finally died today. I watched the last bubbles rise in Tank 7—the final living coral fragment I'd been nursing since Seattle—and knew it was over. The water filtration system sputtered to silence, and with it went the last piece of my old life. Lena would have hated seeing me like this, hunched over a dead coral like it was Maya's grave. But it's all connected, isn't it? The dying oceans, the plague, the way everything beautiful seems to wither. I spent the afternoon talking to the green sea turtle skeleton in the main exhibit. His name was Atlas, according to the plaque. He carried the world on his back too. Found myself explaining coral polyps to his bleached bones, my voice echoing in the cavernous dark. The madness is setting in, I think. Or maybe it's the hunger. Yesterday I caught myself considering eating the last of the fish food pellets. Not for nutrition, but because they were something Lena and I bought together on our anniversary trip to the aquarium. Every object becomes a memorial now. Every silence fills with ghosts. When the last light faded from Tank 7, I didn't cry. I just pressed my forehead against the cool glass and remembered Maya's hand in mine, the way she'd marvel at the 'sea flowers' during our visits here. Now I'm the last specimen in this decaying museum, waiting for my own systems to fail.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (15lbs under healthy weight), saltwater sores on hands and arms, chronic cough from damp conditions. Mentally: Severe depression with moments of dissociation, talks to inanimate objects, experiences vivid memories that blur with reality. Sleeps only 2-3 hours at a time.",
      "discoveries": "Saltwater can preserve certain food items longer than fresh water. The aquarium's emergency desalination unit still functions with manual power. Found that certain algae growing in the tanks are edible when boiled—though the taste is unbearable.",
      "warnings": "Never trust canned goods with bulging lids, even if they're from 'safe' locations. The infected are drawn to light sources at night—use blackout curtains religiously. Saltwater contamination in wounds leads to infections that antibiotics can't touch. And the deepest warning: don't become too attached to anything that still breathes.",
      "last_meal": "Boiled kelp and half a can of sardines (36 hours ago). Drank desalinated water collected from morning condensation.",
      "companions": "Currently alone. Lost Lena and Maya during the evacuation of Portland (Day 23). Traveled for three months with a fisherman named Elias who taught him coastal survival—died from infected wound (Day 142). The coral in Tank 7 was his last companion.",
