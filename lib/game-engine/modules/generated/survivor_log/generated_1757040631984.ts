      "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 6). Was writing a book about the Great Barrier Reef's recovery patterns. Dreamed of taking his family sailing around the world to study marine life.",
      "day_number": 127,
      "location": "Abandoned aquarium research facility, Newport. Salt-crusted windows, the constant drip of leaking tanks, and the ghostly blue glow of emergency lighting that somehow still functions. The air smells of decay and saltwater.",
      "entry": "Day 127. The generators finally died today. The hum I'd grown so accustomed to has been replaced by an eerie silence, broken only by the dripping and the distant sound of waves crashing against the pier. I watched the last of the surviving fish in Tank 7 go still this morning - a beautiful yellow tang that had somehow made it this long. Buried it in the sand garden out back. Felt like burying a piece of my old life all over again.\n\nFound a child's drawing tucked in an old lab notebook today. Crude crayon picture of a family holding hands under a rainbow. Made me think of Maya's drawings that used to cover our refrigerator. My hands shook so badly I had to sit down. The guilt is a physical weight in my chest - should have been home that night instead of working late on grant proposals. Could have reached them faster. Could have...\n\nBut then I remember Lena's last message on the emergency band: 'Stay safe. The girls need at least one parent.' So I keep going. Today I managed to repair the water filtration system using parts from the broken generators. Small victory, but it means clean water for another week. Sometimes I talk to the empty tanks as if my students are still here, lecturing about marine adaptation. Madness? Maybe. But it keeps the other voices away.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (down 15kg), saltwater rash on hands and arms, but surprisingly healthy overall. Mentally: Struggling with severe guilt and occasional auditory hallucinations of his family's voices. Sleeps in 2-3 hour intervals, constantly alert.",
      "discoveries": "The aquarium's emergency desalination system can be manually operated with minimal power. Certain species of mollusks growing on the pier are safe to eat and rich in nutrients. The infected seem to avoid saltwater areas - possibly due to the corrosion effect on their compromised tissues.",
      "warnings": "Never drink untreated rainwater collected from rooftops - acidic residue from the atmospheric changes makes it toxic. The infected are drawn to fresh water sources. Saltwater purification is essential. Watch for signs of mental deterioration - loneliness can be as deadly as any infection.",
      "last_meal": "Steamed mussels and boiled kelp gathered from the pier supports, eaten approximately 6 hours ago. Seasoned with dried seaweed flakes from the research pantry.",
      "companions": "Alone. Lost contact with his research assistant, Ben, during the initial evacuation. His wife and daughters were at their home across the bay when the outbreak hit. No confirmation of their fate, but the neighborhood was overrun in the first week.",
      "hope_level": 4
