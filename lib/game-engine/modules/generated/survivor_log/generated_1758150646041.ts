      "author_name": "Elara Vance",
      "author_background": "Marine biologist specializing in coral reef conservation. Married to David for eight years, no children but hoping to start a family. Dreamed of opening a marine education center in the Florida Keys. Lost David during the initial evacuation chaos.",
      "day_number": 327,
      "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Maine coast. Salt-crusted windows face a perpetually gray sea. The rotting wooden floorboards groan with every step, and the smell of damp wool and despair hangs thick in the air.",
      "entry": "Day 327. The sea is the only thing that hasn't changed. It still breathes, in and out, indifferent to our suffering. I watched a pod of dolphins this morning, their sleek bodies cutting through the water with a grace we've forgotten. For a moment, I was back on our research vessel, David laughing as a spray of saltwater caught me in the face. The memory was so vivid I could almost feel his hand in mine. The ache that followed was a physical blow. I've started talking to him. Out loud. Full conversations. I told him about the nettle soup I made yesterday, how I burned my tongue. I asked if he remembered that little bistro in Portland with the terrible clam chowder. It's madness, I know. But the silence here... it's a living thing. It presses in on you. The words, even spoken to a ghost, keep it at bay. Today, I had to make a choice. A young man, couldn't have been more than nineteen, stumbled into the cove below. He was gaunt, terrified, bleeding from a gash on his arm. He saw the smoke from my chimney and cried out for help. But I saw the fresh bite mark on his forearm, clear as day. The fever was already starting to glaze his eyes. I stood at the top of the cliff path with my rifle. He begged. I remember the exact sound of his voice breaking on the word 'please.' I didn't shoot him. I just watched. I watched as the thing that used to be him finally stood up, movements becoming jerky and wrong. Then I put a bullet through its head. The shot echoed across the water, and the gulls scattered. I didn't cry. I don't think I can anymore. I just came inside and wrote this. The guilt is a cold stone in my gut. But the alternative was worse.",
      "condition": "Physically malnourished but functional; constant low-grade cough from the damp. Mentally frayed, experiencing auditory hallucinations of her husband's voice and prolonged dissociative episodes. Hands have a permanent tremor.",
      "discoveries": "Saltwater can effectively purify questionable water if boiled afterward. The infected are drawn to consistent, repetitive sounds (like a loose shutter banging) but disoriented by complex, irregular noise. They avoid deep, rushing salt water.",
      "warnings": "Never trust a clear, easy pathâ€”it's almost always a trap set by raiders. A fresh bite means it's already over; sentimentality will get you killed. Check the tides twice daily; low tide exposes razor-sharp barnacles that can cripple you.",
      "last_meal": "A thin soup made from rehydrated dried nettles, a small piece of salted cod, and a handful of limp dulse seaweed, eaten approximately 6 hours ago.",
      "companions": "Officially alone. Unofficially, accompanied by the memory of her husband, David, to whom she speaks regularly. Lost her entire research team during the initial outbreak evacuation.",
      "hope_level": 3
