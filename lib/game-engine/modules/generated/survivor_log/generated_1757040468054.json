  "author_background": "Architect specializing in sustainable design, married to David with two children (Sophie, 8 and Leo, 5). Dreamed of building eco-friendly communities and traveling the world with her family.",
  "day_number": 327,
  "location": "Abandoned elementary school library in what was once Maple Creek, Oregon. Rain patters against broken windows while mold creeps up walls where children's artwork still hangs crookedly.",
  "entry": "The rain sounds like fingers tapping today—like Sophie used to do on my desk when she wanted attention. Day 327 in this decaying library that smells of wet paper and regret. Found a child's drawing today tucked in a copy of 'Where the Wild Things Are.' A purple monster with too many teeth, signed 'Emma, Grade 2' in wobbly letters. I should have left it. Instead I sat on the dusty carpet and cried until my throat felt raw. David would have hated seeing me like this. He always said tears were saltwater wasting precious hydration. But he's not here to scold me anymore. The memory of his last moments still plays behind my eyelids every time I blink—pushing me through that fire escape, his hand slipping from mine as the infected swarmed him. Sometimes I wonder if I should have stayed. Held his hand tighter. Died with him. But then I remember Sophie's laugh and Leo's tiny hand in mine at the zoo, and I keep breathing. Today I realized survival isn't about being brave—it's about being too stubborn to stop. Even when every part of you wants to.",
  "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (ribs visible), deep cut on left forearm healing poorly, constant mild dehydration. Mentally: Grief-stricken but functional, experiences auditory hallucinations of her children's voices during heavy rain.",
  "discoveries": "Rainwater collected in certain types of plastic containers becomes undrinkable within 48 hours—develops a toxic film. The infected avoid areas with strong mint scent (discovered using abandoned toothpaste tubes).",
  "warnings": "Never seek shelter in music schools—the infected are drawn to piano sounds. Canned goods with bulging lids will kill you faster than starvation. Trust no one who claims to have 'government supplies'—they're always lying.",
  "last_meal": "Half can of cold beans and rainwater collected in a cleaned paint can (14 hours ago)",
  "companions": "Alone. Lost husband David on Day 298. Children Sophie and Leo presumed dead since the initial evacuation chaos (Day 17).",
