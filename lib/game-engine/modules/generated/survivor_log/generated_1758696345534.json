  "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 6). Was leading a research expedition in the Pacific when the outbreak began. Dreamed of establishing marine conservation zones and writing children's books about ocean life.",
  "day_number": 347,
  "location": "Abandoned coastal research station on what was once Catalina Island. The station smells of salt, rust, and decaying seaweed. Broken equipment litters the lab, and the constant sound of waves against the crumbling pier provides a rhythmic backdrop to the silence.",
  "entry": "Day 347. The generator finally died today. Not with a bang, but with a sputtering cough that sounded almost human. I've been nursing it along for months, scavenging parts from other ruined buildings along the coast. Without power, the water purifier is useless. Without clean water... well, I've seen what happens.\n\nI found myself talking to Lena again today. Standing by the broken radio, I described the way the sunset painted the oil-slicked water crimson and gold. She always loved sunsets. Sometimes I can almost hear her response, a ghost in the static.\n\nThe girls would have turned 9 and 7 last month. I marked the dates on the wall with a piece of charcoal. Sophie wanted to be an astronaut. Maya collected seashells. I try to remember their laughter, but the memories are getting fuzzy around the edges, like photographs left in the sun.\n\nToday I had to make a choice. A family—a man, woman, and boy no older than Maya—tried to land their small boat at my pier. They looked exhausted, skeletal. The man held up empty water containers. I had three days' worth of purified water left. Just enough to maybe find another solution.\n\nI pointed my rifle and told them to leave. The boy started crying. The way his shoulders shook reminded me of Maya when she'd scraped her knee learning to ride a bike. I watched them paddle away until they disappeared into the haze. My hands haven't stopped trembling since.\n\nWhat kind of world makes us choose between our own survival and basic decency? What would Lena think of the man I've become? The scientist who once dedicated his life to preservation now points guns at children.\n\nBut then I looked at the charcoal marks on the wall. However faint those memories become, they're worth preserving. They're the last proof that something beautiful once existed in this world.",
  "condition": "Physically malnourished (down 40 pounds from pre-outbreak weight), suffering from chronic dehydration. Mentally fragile—experiences auditory hallucinations of his family, particularly when exhausted. Hands show tremors from stress and guilt. Sleeps in brief, fitful bursts.",
  "discoveries": "Realized today that hope isn't about believing things will get better—it's about refusing to let the memory of goodness die completely. Also discovered that the coastal currents have shifted, bringing less contaminated water closer to shore at specific tidal cycles.",
  "warnings": "Saltwater contamination is worse than radiation now—the thirst will drive you to drink it, but two gulps will kill you faster than any infected. Trust no one who approaches by sea—pirates use families as bait. Check tidal charts if you find any—the two hours after high tide are safest for coastal movement.",
  "last_meal": "Half a can of expired tuna (found in station wreckage) and a handful of edible seaweed harvested at low tide. Eaten approximately 14 hours ago.",
  "companions": "Alone. Lost contact with research team during initial evacuation chaos. Presumes wife and daughters perished in mainland outbreak. Occasionally talks to figments of their memories.",
  "hope_level": 3
