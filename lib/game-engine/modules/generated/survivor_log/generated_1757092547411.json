  "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Elena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 5). Was weeks away from leading a research expedition to the Great Barrier Reef when the outbreak began. Dreamed of discovering new marine species and publishing groundbreaking research on climate change adaptation in coral systems.",
  "day_number": 347,
  "location": "Abandoned aquarium research facility, coastal Maine. Salt-crusted windows overlook grey, churning waters. The once-pristine labs now smell of decay and saltwater, with broken tanks littering the floors and emergency lighting casting long shadows.",
  "entry": "Day 347. The generators finally died today. The hum that's been my constant companion these eleven months fell silent, and in that quiet, I heard the waves again. Proper waves, not the filtered sounds through reinforced glass. Real ocean.\n\nI found myself standing before the last functioning tank—my little piece of the before times. The clownfish pair I've been nurturing since the outbreak began were swimming their endless circles, oblivious to the world ending outside their glass walls. Elena always loved clownfish. Said they reminded her of our wedding in Bali, swimming together in that warm turquoise water.\n\nToday I faced the terrible arithmetic of survival. The backup power for their filtration system will last maybe 48 hours. The canned goods in the staff kitchen will last me three weeks. But to keep them alive? That would require siphoning fuel from our emergency vehicle, risking scavenging runs into infected territory.\n\nI sat there for hours watching them dance through their artificial anemones. Sophie would have named them by now—probably something ridiculous like 'Bubbles' and 'Sparkles.' She always had names for everything.\n\nWhen the sun began to set, painting the crashing waves outside in hues of blood and gold, I made my choice. I opened the tank lid and reached in one last time, feeling the familiar cool water. They didn't flee my hand—they never did. I think they recognized me as their keeper.\n\nI released them into the ocean from the broken loading dock. Watched their orange and white bodies disappear into the vast grey expanse. Either they'll adapt or they won't. Either they'll find their place in this new world or become someone else's meal.\n\nWe all make choices about what we save. Today I chose to stop preserving the past and start believing in the future.",
  "condition": "Physically: Malnourished but functional. Saltwater sores on hands from maintaining tanks. Mentally: Emerging from months of depressive isolation. The act of release has sparked something resembling clarity.",
  "discoveries": "The ocean currents have changed dramatically—likely due to the collapse of human industry. Marine life is adapting faster than terrestrial ecosystems. Some fish species appear to be thriving in the new conditions.",
  "warnings": "Saltwater contamination in wounds leads to rapid infection without proper antibiotics. Coastal areas experience stronger tidal surges than before the collapse—never camp below the high tide line. Marine predators have become more aggressive and will hunt closer to shore.",
  "last_meal": "Cold canned chili and stale crackers (14 hours ago), eaten while watching the tank filters slowly stop bubbling.",
  "companions": "Alone since Day 89 when the last research team member (Dr. Chen) didn't return from a supply run. Frequently talks to the memory of his family as if they're still with him.",
