      "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "author_background": "Former marine biologist specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena for 12 years, father to 8-year-old Maya. Was leading a research expedition in the Pacific when the outbreak began. Dreamed of establishing marine conservation zones and publishing children's books about ocean life.",
      "day_number": 347,
      "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage on Stormwatch Point, Maine. The structure groans with each gust of wind, salt crusts every window, and the rotating beam above casts eerie, sweeping shadows through broken floorboards.",
      "entry": "The storm finally broke today. Three days of howling wind that sounded like the dead trying to get in. I spent most of it huddled in the corner where the roof still holds, watching water cascade down the walls like tears. Funny how the lighthouse still works—this automated beam sweeping over a dead ocean, guiding no one home.\n\nI found a child's drawing wedged between floorboards today. A crayon sun over a blue scribble that might be sea or sky. It broke something in me. I sat there for hours, tracing the waxy lines, remembering Maya's drawings taped to our refrigerator. She always gave the sun a smiling face.\n\nYesterday, I had to make a choice. A family—mother, father, girl about Maya's age—stumbled up the path. They were starving, hollow-eyed. The father carried a makeshift spear, but his hands shook so badly he could barely grip it. I had exactly four cans of beans left. Enough for me to stretch another week. Enough for them to survive maybe two days.\n\nI turned them away. Told them the lighthouse was contaminated. Watched from the broken window as the little girl stumbled on the rocks below, her mother pulling her upright. Their silhouettes disappeared into the coastal fog, and I became the monster I always feared was waiting inside me.\n\nThe beam rotates. Light, dark, light, dark. Like my conscience these days. I keep telling myself survival requires hard choices. But Lena's voice in my memory whispers, 'What are we surviving for, Aris?'\n\nTonight, for the first time, I didn't climb the tower to watch for ships. What's the point? The world drowned while I was studying coral bleaching. My family is gone. My morality is gone. All that's left is this automated light and a man who turned away a child.",
      "condition": "Malnourished (down 15kg), saltwater sores on hands and lips, persistent cough from damp conditions. Mentally fractured—experiences auditory hallucinations of his daughter's laughter, cycles between numbness and overwhelming guilt.",
      "discoveries": "The lighthouse generator runs on tidal power, making it one of the few consistent energy sources. Radio signals are completely dead, confirming no organized civilization remains. Coastal areas have fewer infected but more desperate survivors.",
      "warnings": "Never trust clear coastal water—salt contamination makes dehydration worse. Groups larger than three are usually predatory. The infected avoid saltwater but can be carried on tides. Rotating light attracts attention at night.",
      "last_meal": "Half-can of cold beans and handful of edible seaweed gathered from rocks below, 14 hours ago.",
      "companions": "Alone. Lost research team during evacuation attempt Day 28. Presumes wife and daughter died in initial outbreak while he was at sea.",
      "hope_level": 2
