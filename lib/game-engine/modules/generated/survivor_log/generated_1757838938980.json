  "author_background": "Former marine biologist specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 5). Was preparing to lead a research expedition to the Great Barrier Reef when the outbreak began. Dreamed of discovering new marine species and protecting endangered ecosystems.",
  "day_number": 347,
  "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Northern California coast. Perched on crumbling cliffs overlooking a gray, restless ocean. The air smells of salt, decay, and the ever-present dampness that seeps into everything.",
  "entry": "Day 347. The rain hasn't stopped for three days. It drums a relentless rhythm on the tin roof, a sound that's become both comfort and torment. Found a child's drawing tucked between the floorboards today - a crude but cheerful sun with a smiling face. It shattered me. I sat there for what felt like hours, tracing the waxy crayon lines with trembling fingers, remembering Maya's drawings taped to our refrigerator. The memory was so vivid I could smell Lena's coffee brewing. Then the guilt crashed over me like one of the waves below. I should have fought harder to reach them. Should have ignored the evacuation orders and tried to make it home. But I was 200 miles away at the research station when everything fell apart. By the time I realized this wasn't some temporary crisis... it was too late. Today I almost didn't boil the water. Almost didn't check the perimeter. The thought whispered: what's the point? But then I remembered Lena's voice telling me I was the most stubborn man she'd ever met. So I got up. I boiled the damn water. I walked the perimeter. And I found those wild blackberries growing along the cliff path. Small victories. That's what she would call them.",
  "condition": "Physically: Malnourished but functional. Persistent cough from the damp. Several healing cuts on hands from scavenging. Mentally: Wrestling with severe depression and guilt. Moments of clarity punctuate the fog of grief. Sleep is fractured by nightmares of his family's fate.",
  "discoveries": "The coastal fogs seem to disorient the infected - they move more slowly and appear confused near the shore. Salt water can be used to preserve certain foods longer than expected. Found that pages from old books make decent tinder when dry.",
  "warnings": "Never drink unboiled water, even rainwater. The infection lingers in water sources. Avoid coastal caves at high tide - they become death traps. Trust no one who approaches too confidently - the desperate and the predatory have learned to mimic normalcy.",
  "last_meal": "Boiled dandelion roots and a handful of wild blackberries (approximately 6 hours ago). Found a cache of canned beans two days ago but rationing strictly.",
  "companions": "Alone. Lost contact with research team members Dr. Chen and Ben during initial outbreak. Family status unknown - last communication indicated they reached an evacuation center that later fell. Sometimes talks to the gulls as if they might carry messages.",
