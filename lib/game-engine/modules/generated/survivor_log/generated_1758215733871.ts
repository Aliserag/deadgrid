      "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Elena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Mia, 5). Was writing a book about the Great Barrier Reef's recovery and dreamed of taking his family sailing around the world.",
      "day_number": 147,
      "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage on the rocky coast of Maine. The structure groans with each gust of wind, and salt spray constantly mists the single intact window. The smell of damp wood and decaying seaweed permeates everything.",
      "entry": "The storm finally broke around midnight. For twelve hours, I watched waves the size of apartment buildings try to swallow this damned rock. Each crash sounded like the world ending all over again. I kept thinking about that last video call with Elena - her trying to be brave while sirens wailed in the background. 'The girls are asking for you,' she'd said. That was Day 3. I haven't heard another human voice in 42 days. Today I found myself talking to a seagull with a broken wing. Offered him some of my precious dried fish. He just stared at me with those black eyes that understood nothing and everything. I buried him near the cliff edge when the wind died down. Said some words. Felt like burying another piece of myself. The silence afterwards was worse than the storm. Sometimes I wonder if I'm the last person left on this entire coast. The radio static mocks me every evening. But today, while checking my traps, I saw footprints in the wet sand that weren't mine. They were gone by the time the tide turned, but someone was here. Someone alive. My hands won't stop shaking as I write this.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (15lbs underweight), saltwater sores on hands and lips, chronic cough from damp conditions. Mentally: Severe isolation-induced anxiety, episodes of paranoia, but moments of sharp clarity when survival demands it.",
      "discoveries": "The infected avoid saltwater - they won't cross even ankle-deep tidal pools. Seagulls are safe to eat if cooked thoroughly. Rainwater collected in certain moss beds tastes less metallic. The footprints prove I'm not alone on this coast.",
      "warnings": "Never travel at high tide - the waves will sweep you out in seconds. Boiling seawater doesn't make it drinkable - it only accelerates dehydration. If you find other survivors, watch them for three days before revealing yourself. Trust is more dangerous than hunger.",
      "last_meal": "Boiled mussels and dandelion greens (11 hours ago) collected from the rocks at low tide. Drank rainwater from my collection barrel.",
      "companions": "Alone since my research assistant, Ben, jumped from the cliff on Day 38. He kept saying the waves were calling him home. I couldn't stop him. Sometimes I still hear his voice in the wind.",
      "hope_level": 4
