  "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 6). Was writing a book about the Great Barrier Reef's recovery and dreamed of taking his family sailing around the world.",
  "day_number": 347,
  "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Northern California coast. The structure groans with each gust of wind, salt crusting every window. The rotating beam still cuts through the fog every night, powered by solar panels I desperately maintain.",
  "entry": "The rain hasn't stopped for three days. It drums against the tin roof in a rhythm that's become both comfort and torment. Today I found myself talking to the lighthouse lamp again—calling it 'Old reliable' like some pathetic castaway from a bad novel. The loneliness eats at you in ways I never imagined. Yesterday I caught myself setting four places at the table with rusted utensils before I remembered. The remembering is always the worst part.\n\nI nearly died today. Went down to the rocky shore to check my crab traps, lost my footing on the slick stones. The waves dragged me under like cold hands pulling me down to join them. For a moment, I stopped fighting. It would be so easy to let go. But then I saw Lena's face in the bubbles—that way she'd tilt her head when I'd come home smelling of seawater and lab chemicals. I fought my way back to air.\n\nBack in the lighthouse, shivering by my precious dwindling fire, I realized something terrible: I'm starting to forget the sound of Maya's laugh. I can still see her gap-toothed smile, but the audio is fading. I've started singing their favorite lullaby every night now, afraid the melody might abandon me too. What happens when all the sounds are gone? When their voices become silent movies in my mind?\n\nThe worst part isn't the hunger or the cold—it's becoming a museum curator of a world that no longer exists, with only one visitor.",
  "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (ribs visible), saltwater rash on hands and neck, persistent cough from damp conditions. Mentally: Severe loneliness with occasional auditory hallucinations (hears daughters calling), maintains strict routines to preserve sanity.",
  "discoveries": "The infected avoid saltwater—they won't cross even ankle-deep waves. The lighthouse lens can be used to start fires on sunny days. Seagull eggs are edible if boiled thoroughly. Keeping a strict daily schedule is the difference between sanity and madness.",
  "warnings": "Never go to the shore during high tide or storm conditions. Check solar connections daily—without power, the light fails and the infected gather. Boil all seawater for at least 20 minutes before drinking. The loneliness will tempt you to take risks—don't listen.",
  "last_meal": "Boiled dandelion greens and two small rock crabs (caught this morning), eaten cold at midday. Drank rainwater collected from the roof.",
  "companions": "Alone. Lost wife Lena and daughter Maya during the evacuation chaos. Daughter Sophie disappeared when their refugee camp was overrun on Day 89. Sometimes talks to a family of seals that frequent the cove below.",
  "hope_level": 3
