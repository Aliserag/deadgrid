      "author_name": "Elara Vance",
      "author_background": "Marine biologist specializing in coral reef conservation. Married to David with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 5). Dreamed of opening a marine education center in the Florida Keys. Last project was documenting bleaching events in the Great Barrier Reef.",
      "day_number": 327,
      "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, rocky coastline of Maine. Salt-crusted windows, peeling blue paint, constant sound of crashing waves and crying gulls. Smells of damp wood and decaying seaweed.",
      "entry": "The storm finally broke today. Three days of howling wind that made the old lighthouse groan like a dying animal. I spent most of it huddled in the corner, wrapped in mildewed blankets, counting the seconds between thunderclaps. When the rain stopped, I found three more jars of preserves in the cellar behind a collapsed shelf - peaches from a world that no longer exists. Their sweetness made me cry. I used to hate canned fruit. David would laugh at me picking through fruit salads at picnics, carefully avoiding anything that came from a can. God, I'd give anything to complain about canned peaches with him again. Today I saw a ship on the horizon - just a dark smudge against the gray sea. I watched until my eyes burned, hoping for movement, for a sign. Nothing. It's probably another ghost ship drifting with the currents, full of things I don't want to imagine. Sometimes I talk to the gulls just to hear a voice, even if it's only mine. I told them about Sophie's obsession with mermaids today. How she'd make me braid seaweed into her hair. The memory felt so real I could almost smell her sun-warmed scalp. Then the hunger returned, as it always does, and the moment vanished like mist.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (ribs visible), salt-water sores on hands and lips, hair brittle and bleached by sun. Mentally: Episodes of dissociation, talks to inanimate objects, but maintains sharp survival instincts. Sleeps in 2-hour intervals.",
      "discoveries": "The lighthouse lens can be used to start fires even in damp conditions. Tide pools at dawn sometimes contain edible mollusks that are safe if boiled thoroughly. The infected avoid salt water - they won't cross even ankle-deep tidal channels.",
      "warnings": "Never eat shellfish from red tide areas - check water coloration at sunrise. Storm surges can raise water levels 15 feet in minutes - always have an escape route to high ground. The infected are learning to mimic human cries - verify visually before responding to any calls for help.",
      "last_meal": "Two boiled periwinkles and half a jar of peaches (8 hours ago). Drank rainwater collected in tarpaulin.",
      "companions": "Alone. David and the girls were lost during the evacuation chaos in Boston. Sometimes imagines the shadow of the previous lighthouse keeper moving through the rooms.",
      "hope_level": 3
