      "author_name": "Elena Vasquez",
      "author_background": "High school biology teacher, married to David (architect), mother to Sofia (age 7). Dreamed of visiting the Galapagos Islands to see evolution in action. Spent weekends gardening and baking with her daughter.",
      "day_number": 327,
      "location": "Abandoned elementary school library, Cedar Creek. Dust motes dance in slanted afternoon light. Bookshelves stand like skeletal remains, water-stained ceiling tiles sag overhead, and the faint scent of mildew and childhood memories lingers.",
      "entry": "The silence is the worst part. Not the empty silence of before, but the heavy, waiting silence that follows screams. Sofia used to laugh in places like this. She’d drag me to the picture book section, her small hand trustingly in mine. Now my hand holds a knife slick with something that isn’t ink. We took shelter here at dawn, pursued by a pack of Ferals drawn by the scent of a rabbit I’d caught. David held the door. His last words were ‘Run. Don’t look back.’ I obeyed. I am a coward. I sit between the shelves of ‘Science & Nature’ and ‘Mythology,’ and the irony is a bitter pill. I read to Sofia from these very books once. Now I read the stains on the floor and calculate how long until they find us. My little girl is curled in a reading nook, shivering. She hasn’t spoken since we ran. She just stares at my bloodied hands. I tried to wipe them clean, but the stain feels permanent. What kind of mother leads her child into a tomb of forgotten stories? What kind of wife leaves her husband to become a story himself? The guilt is a physical weight, crushing my lungs. But then Sofia’s small fingers brushed mine. She didn’t flinch. She just held on. And in that tiny gesture, I found a reason to take my next breath. We are not dead yet.",
      "condition": "Physically exhausted; shallow cut on left forearm, muscles aching from running. Mentally fractured, grappling with severe guilt and trauma, but clinging to a thread of purpose through motherhood.",
      "discoveries": "Ferals are attracted more by the scent of fresh blood and panic than by sound alone. Staying calm is not just mental—it’s tactical. Also discovered the school’s boiler room is still sealed tight; might be a safer temporary shelter.",
      "warnings": "Do not stop moving at night. Ferals are bolder in the dark. If you must hide, find a place with a secondary exit. Never corner yourself. And if you have to choose between a memory and a chance to live… choose to live. The memory will haunt you either way.",
      "last_meal": "A small piece of dried rabbit and two dandelion leaves, shared with Sofia. Eaten roughly 6 hours ago.",
      "companions": "With: Sofia (daughter, age 8). Lost: David (husband), today, at the school entrance.",
      "hope_level": 3
