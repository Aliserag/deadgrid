      "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
      "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena for 12 years, father to 7-year-old Maya. Was leading a research expedition in the Florida Keys when the outbreak began. Dreamed of establishing marine protected areas and publishing children's books about ocean conservation.",
      "day_number": 147,
      "location": "Abandoned aquarium research facility in the Florida Keys - salt-corroded metal walls, broken tanks with algae-covered glass, the constant drip of filtered seawater, and the ghostly blue emergency lighting that somehow still functions",
      "entry": "The generators hum like a dying man's breath. Day 147 in this aquatic tomb. I never thought I'd miss committee meetings and grant proposals, but God, I'd give anything to be arguing about research funding again. Today I found Maya's drawing - the one she made of us as mermaids - tucked in my old field notebook. The paper is salt-stained now, the crayon smeared from my tears. I keep talking to Lena in my head, telling her about the systems I've rigged, how I'm using the aquarium's filtration to create drinking water. She'd be proud. She was always the practical one. Yesterday, I had to barricade the eastern corridor. Something got in - not infected, but wild dogs turned feral. They tore apart what remained of the jellyfish exhibit. I watched through the security camera, my hand trembling on the emergency lockdown button. Part of me wanted to let them in, just to have something alive to talk to. The isolation is eating me from the inside out. But then I remember Maya's laugh, how she'd press her face against these very tanks, mesmerized by the moon jellies. I have to believe she and Lena made it to one of the evacuation ships. I have to believe someone, somewhere, is still looking at the stars and remembering what beauty felt like. Today I managed to repair the radio receiver. Static mostly, but sometimes... sometimes I hear fragments. Voices in the noise. Maybe tomorrow I'll hear them clearly.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished but functional, right hand badly scarred from an early infection, chronic dehydration despite water filtration system. Mentally: Severe depression with moments of lucid determination, experiences auditory hallucinations of his family's voices, sleeps in 2-3 hour intervals due to nightmares",
      "discoveries": "The aquarium's backup power can be sustained indefinitely using tidal generators I've rigged in the damaged tanks; saltwater can be purified through a multi-stage filtration system using available materials; the infected appear to avoid large bodies of water, making coastal areas slightly safer",
      "warnings": "Never trust silence near water - the infected can hold their breath longer than expected; saltwater contamination in wounds leads to rapid infection without proper antibiotics; full moons make them more aggressive near coastal areas; conserve batteries like they're breaths of air",
      "last_meal": "12 hours ago - canned tuna from the staff breakroom (found 3 cans behind a loose panel) mixed with rehydrated seaweed from the abandoned exhibits, chased with filtered rainwater",
      "companions": "Alone since Day 23 when Dr. Chen sacrificed himself to draw the horde away from the facility. Lost contact with wife Lena and daughter Maya during the initial evacuation. Occasionally talks to a one-eyed seagull that perches on the broken observation deck - named him 'Captain'",
