  "author_name": "Dr. Evelyn Reed",
  "author_background": "Former pediatric surgeon, married to Michael (architect), mother to Lily (age 7). Dreamed of opening a free clinic for underprivileged children. Last vacation was hiking in the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
  "day_number": 187,
  "location": "Abandoned elementary school library, Knoxville, Tennessee. Dust motes dance in the slanted afternoon light filtering through broken windows. The smell of old books, mildew, and desperation hangs heavy in the air. Tiny chairs are overturned, and a forgotten, crumbling diorama of the solar system sits on a central table.",
  "entry": "The silence in this place is a living thing. It’s not peaceful; it’s the silence of interrupted futures. I sit where the story-time rug used to be, surrounded by skeletons of books, their pages warped and eaten by damp. I read to Lily today. ‘Where the Wild Things Are.’ Her favorite. Her small, fever-hot body was curled against my side, her breathing a shallow, raspy thing that claws at my heart. I had to stop twice because my voice broke. I’m a doctor. I was a doctor. I’ve performed intricate surgeries on hearts no bigger than a walnut. But I can’t fix a simple infection. The antibiotics we scavenged from the CVS are useless, a decade past their expiration. Every cough from her tiny frame is a judgment on my failure. Michael would have known what to do. He was always the practical one, the builder, the fixer. He’d have rigged a still for clean water, fortified the windows, something. He died for a can of peaches. A stupid, mundane can of fruit. Pushed me out of the way of a Raider’s bullet and took it in the chest. His last words were ‘Keep her singing.’ Lily hasn’t sung in weeks. I’d give my right arm, my medical degree, every last scrap of my humanity, just to hear her hum again. The world didn’t end with zombies or asteroids. It ended with the slow, mundane cruelty of a scraped knee turning septic. We fought monsters, only to be defeated by bacteria.",
  "condition": "Physically exhausted; deep circles under eyes, hands slightly shaky from hunger and stress. A cut on her forearm is red and inflamed. Mentally, she is on the razor's edge of collapse, gripped by profound grief and medical helplessness, her professional identity shattered by her inability to save her own child.",
  "discoveries": "Realized that expired medical supplies, especially antibiotics, are worse than useless—they provide a false hope that wastes precious time. True medicine now is cleanliness, rest, and luck. Also discovered that grief is a heavier burden than any backpack, and it doesn't get easier to carry; you just get used to the weight.",
  "warnings": "Do not trust expired medication. The risk of adverse reaction or simply no effect is too high. Prioritize finding unopened alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, and clean bandages over anything else in a pharmacy. Infection is a quieter, deadlier hunter than any Raider.",
  "last_meal": "A quarter can of cold baked beans and a few sips of water, shared with Lily 8 hours ago.",
  "companions": "With her dying daughter, Lily. Lost her husband, Michael, 43 days ago. Presumes the rest of her family and friends are dead or lost.",
