  "author_name": "Elara Vance",
  "author_background": "Former marine biologist and mother of two. Worked at Monterey Bay Aquarium researching cephalopod intelligence. Married to David for 15 years. Dreamed of publishing research on octopus communication and watching her children graduate college.",
  "day_number": 327,
  "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Point Reyes National Seashore. Salt-crusted windows face raging Pacific storms. The rotating lens mechanism above creaks like a dying animal with each gust of wind.",
  "entry": "The storm has been screaming for three days straight. I keep imagining it's the world finally tearing itself completely apart. Found a child's drawing wedged between floorboards today - purple crayon sun, stick figures holding hands. Made me sit on this damp floor and sob until my ribs ached. I used to tell Maya and Leo that storms were just the ocean singing too loud. What do you tell children when the ocean isn't the loudest thing anymore? Yesterday I had to choose between boarding up the last window or saving the remaining firewood from getting soaked. Chose the wood. Practicality over light. David would have hated that - he always said light was everything. Sometimes I talk to him just to hear something that isn't wind or my own breathing. Today I realized I can't quite remember the exact shade of Maya's eyes. Were they hazel like mine or more green like her father's? That forgetting feels like losing her all over again. But then I found rainwater collected in the lighthouse lens housing - enough for two more days. Small mercies. Small horrors. The math of survival keeps changing.",
  "condition": "Malnourished (down 15kg), saltwater sores on hands, chronic cough from damp conditions. Mentally: swings between hyper-alertness and dissociative episodes. Sometimes forgets to blink for minutes at a time.",
  "discoveries": "Saltwater can be distilled using makeshift solar stills if you have plastic sheeting. The infected avoid extreme weather - storms provide temporary safety. Seagull eggs remain edible for weeks if kept cool.",
  "warnings": "Never travel at high tide - the changed coastline hides new drop-offs. Check all shellfish for red tide contamination. Trust no groups smaller than three - lone survivors are usually bait.",
  "last_meal": "Boiled mussels and dandelion greens (18 hours ago). Found clinging to rocks at low tide. Still taste the iron tang of blood from cutting my hands prying them loose.",
  "companions": "Alone. David and the children were lost during the evacuation chaos at Day 12. Sometimes talks to a family of seals that haul out on the rocks below - calls them 'the committee'.",
