  "author_background": "Cardiothoracic surgeon, married with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Lena, 5). Was days away from presenting groundbreaking research on tissue regeneration at an international conference. Dreamed of opening a free clinic for underprivileged communities.",
  "day_number": 187,
  "location": "Abandoned elementary school library, Cedar Creek. Dust motes dance in the slivers of light cutting through boarded windows. The scent of old books, mildew, and despair hangs heavy in the air. Tiny chairs are overturned, and a forgotten, moldy apple core sits on a desk.",
  "entry": "Day 187. The silence in this place is a physical weight. It’s not just the absence of sound; it’s the absence of life, of laughter, of small, scuffing shoes running down these halls. I hide here, among the skeletons of knowledge, because the ghosts here are quieter than my own. I operated on prime ministers and paupers. I held a human heart in my hands, felt its stubborn, miraculous beat. And for what? To end up here, scrounging for canned beans in a world that has flatlined. I found a child’s drawing today, tucked in a copy of ‘Where the Wild Things Are.’ A green crayon sun, a lopsided house, three stick figures. It shattered me. It was Lena’s drawing style. I sat on the gritty carpet and sobbed until my throat was raw, the paper crumpled in my fist. I was so angry—at the world, at the infected, at myself for not being there. For being stuck in the OR when the evacuation alarms sounded, for choosing my duty over sprinting to their school. The ultimate irony: a man who dedicated his life to saving others couldn't save the only people who truly mattered. But as the rage subsided, leaving me hollow, I smoothed out the drawing. That child, whoever they were, believed in a sun that shone and a home that was safe. They put that hope on paper. Maybe that’s all we can do now. Not perform miracles, but just… put our hope on paper. Remember what we’re fighting for, even if it’s just a memory. I’m not saving anyone anymore. I’m just a man trying to deserve the memory of his family.",
  "condition": "Physically depleted; ribs visible, hands shaky from low caloric intake and constant adrenaline. A deep, poorly healed gash on his left forearm shows signs of infection. Mentally, he is oscillating between profound grief and a grim, mechanical determination. Suffers from insomnia and auditory hallucinations of his daughters' voices.",
  "discoveries": "Realized that hoarding medical supplies is pointless if you're dead. True currency is now clean water, antibiotics, and trust. Also discovered that the infected are drawn to consistent, high-pitched sounds—like a car alarm or a whistle—but become disoriented by complex, overlapping noises.",
  "warnings": "Avoid hospitals and clinics at all costs. They were the epicenters of the initial panic and are now deathtraps of the infected and desperate scavengers. The supplies are long gone, but the danger remains. Boil all water for a minimum of ten minutes, even if it looks clear. Dysentery will kill you faster than a horde.",
  "last_meal": "A half-can of cold, unlabeled beans and a handful of dandelion greens scavenged from the school's overgrown football field. Eaten approximately 14 hours ago.",
  "companions": "None. His surgical team was overrun on Day 12. Confirmed his wife and daughters did not make it to the designated safe zone. He has been utterly alone since Day 28.",
