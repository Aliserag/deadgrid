  "author_name": "Dr. Aris Thorne",
  "author_background": "Former marine biologist and university professor specializing in coral reef ecosystems. Married to Lena with two daughters (Sophie, 8 and Maya, 6). Was writing a book about the Great Barrier Reef's recovery and dreamed of taking his family sailing around the world.",
  "day_number": 347,
  "location": "Abandoned lighthouse keeper's cottage, Northern California coast. The structure leans precariously toward the sea, its stone walls weeping with salt and damp. The rotating beam still functions somehow, casting periodic light through broken windows.",
  "entry": "The storm finally broke around dawn. Three days of howling wind and horizontal rain that felt like needles on exposed skin. I spent most of it huddled in the upper gallery, watching the ocean try to claim what's left of this crumbling sentinel. The waves looked like dirty teeth chewing at the cliffs.\n\nFound something washed up in the cove below when the tide retreated—a child's backpack, bright pink with cartoon dolphins. My breath caught in my throat. Maya had one just like it for kindergarten. I scrambled down the slippery rocks, heart hammering, half-expecting to find... I don't know what.\n\nJust school supplies inside. Moldy notebooks, broken crayons, a small waterlogged teddy bear. No blood. No signs of violence. Just ordinary things from an ordinary life that doesn't exist anymore. I sat there on the wet stones and cried for the first time in months. Not just for my girls, but for all the children who won't ever use crayons again.\n\nWhen I finally opened the main compartment, I found the real treasure: two unopened cans of peaches and a sealed bottle of water. The irony wasn't lost on me—survival provisions in a dead child's backpack. I almost left it there. Almost.\n\nBut I brought it back up. I'm eating the peaches as I write this. Each sweet slice feels like a betrayal of something fundamental, but my hands shake with hunger and my body doesn't care about morality. The world ended, but our need to keep living didn't.",
  "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (ribs visible), saltwater sores on hands and lips, chronic cough from damp conditions. Mentally: Haunted by memories, swings between numbness and overwhelming grief, sleeps fitfully with nightmares of his family.",
  "discoveries": "The lighthouse mechanism still has power from solar backups—the rotating light might be visible for miles. Also discovered that seagulls nest on the eastern cliff face, meaning potential food source if I can reach them.",
  "warnings": "Don't trust calm waters after storms—they often wash up contaminated debris. Always check supplies for water damage before consuming. The infected seem disoriented by the lighthouse beam at night—might be useful for evasion.",
  "last_meal": "Canned peaches (about 4 hours ago) and a handful of boiled kelp from the rocks below. Drank collected rainwater from the cistern.",
  "companions": "Alone since Day 89 when Lena didn't wake up from the fever. Never found the girls after the evacuation center was overrun. Sometimes talks to the seagulls as if they might answer.",
  "hope_level": 3
