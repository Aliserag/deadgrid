      "author_name": "Dr. Evelyn Reed",
      "author_background": "Former pediatric surgeon at Johns Hopkins, married to David (architect) with twin daughters, Chloe and Maya (age 7). Dreamed of opening a free clinic for underprivileged children. Last vacation was building medical facilities in Guatemala.",
      "day_number": 187,
      "location": "Abandoned elementary school library, Towson, Maryland. Dusty books scattered like fallen leaves, rain tapping rhythmically on broken windows, the scent of mildew and old paper hanging heavy in the air.",
      "entry": "The rain sounds like fingers tapping on glass today. It's almost peaceful until I remember the last time I heard that sound - Chloe's small hands against the car window as we drove away from our burning neighborhood. Day 187. The calendar on the wall still shows March, frozen in time like everything else. Found a child's drawing today tucked in 'Charlotte's Web' - a purple sun with a smiling face. It undid me completely. Sat in the reading corner and wept until my throat felt raw. I used to save lives. Now I count the days between canned food discoveries. Yesterday I had to choose between helping a wounded stranger or preserving our dwindling medical supplies. I chose the supplies. The ghost of my oath whispers 'do no harm' while the living reality hisses 'survive.' David would have hated what I've become. But David's bones are probably bleaching somewhere near Route 695. Sometimes I talk to the books - ask Dickens about human nature, question whether Bradbury saw this coming. The silence that answers is the truest thing left.",
      "condition": "Physically: Malnourished (down 15kg), healing gash on left forearm from scavenging, chronic cough from damp environments. Mentally: Cycling between clinical detachment and overwhelming grief, experiencing survivor's guilt with vivid nightmares of medical triage scenarios.",
      "discoveries": "Rainwater collected in plastic slides on the playground is safer than standing water. The infected avoid areas with strong vinegar smells. School nurse's office still has usable bandages if you dig past the rubble.",
      "warnings": "Don't trust groups larger than 3 - they're either desperate or predatory. Schools are good for supplies but attract other scavengers. Always check books for notes - others leave warnings and maps in margins.",
      "last_meal": "Cold canned peaches (8 hours ago) and two dry crackers from a teacher's desk, eaten slowly to make it feel like more.",
      "companions": "Alone since Day 42 when Maya didn't wake up from the fever. Chloe taken by raiders on Day 67. David lost during the initial evacuation. Sometimes talk to a family of rats living in the cafeteria wall - named them after my surgical team.",
