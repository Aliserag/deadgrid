# Survivor Log - Day 13

**Location:** Central Station, Forgotten Tunnels  
**Weather:** Thick fog clings to everything like a shroud  

That damn transmission still echoes in my skull. "They're learning..." Learning *what* exactly? I spent half the night trying to boost my handheld's signal, but all I got was static and that creeping feeling of being watched. The flickering emergency lights make shadows dance in the fungal growths, and every drip of water sounds like footsteps.

The fog down here is worse than topside - it moves like something alive through the tunnels. My reinforced flashlight barely cuts through it, the beam reflecting off the moisture in the air. Found fresh Watcher markings near the generator room - three parallel scratches and what might be blood. They're definitely still active down here.

Ellie showed up at first light, emerging from the fog so quietly I nearly shot her. The woman moves like a ghost. Says she's been tracking some new kind of infected near the collapsed tunnel - "They don't moan anymore." She traded me two food rations for a spare flashlight, then vanished back into the mist before I could ask more.

**Today's Priorities:**
1. Check the supply cache before the Caravan Collective beats me to it
2. Reinforce the station entrance with scrap metal
3. Find clean water - my canteen's been empty since yesterday

That fungal growth near the abandoned train car looks... different today. More organized. I swear it's spread another foot since dawn. Might need to burn it out before-

## Night Action + Event Results

**Signal Attempt:**  
Your boosted transmission attracted unexpected attention. The Watchers left a response near the generator room - a gutted radio with its circuitry arranged in a spiral pattern. The Caravan Collective must have intercepted your frequency too; fresh boot prints lead toward the supply cache.

**Random Event (Nothing):**  
The fog dampened all activity tonight. No attacks, no migrations - just an eerie quiet broken occasionally by what might have been distant screams or just the wind through tunnel vents.

## Weather Effects

The moderate fog:
- Reduced visibility to 30 feet (-5% perception)
- Dampened all sound, making infected harder to detect
- Caused moisture damage to unprotected gear (-1 durability to non-reinforced items)
- Created perfect conditions for Ellie's stealthy approach
