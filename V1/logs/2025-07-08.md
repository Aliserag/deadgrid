# Survivor Log - Day 36

**Location:** Fort Crimson - Barracks  
**Weather:** Thick fog clings to everything like a shroud  

The floodlights keep cutting out, plunging sections of the base into complete darkness for minutes at a time. When they flicker back on, the fog makes the beams look like solid columns of light - and sometimes I swear I see shapes moving through them. My fungal sensitivity is going haywire; the vibrations feel like someone dragging fingernails across my skull.  

Found something interesting near the command center - fresh boot prints in the dust that don't match military issue. Too large to be Watchers, too deep for Fog Dwellers. Iron Vanguard maybe? They left one of their damn spike traps near the armory door. Nearly lost a foot to it.  

The antibiotics are gone. All of them. That wasn't zombies. Someone's been in my stash while I slept.

### Night Action Results  
**Rest Attempt:** Fitful sleep at best. The fungal vibrations kept syncing with the flickering floodlights, creating pulsing shadows that made my skin crawl.  
- Health: +3 (recovered from minor wounds)  
- Morale: -5 (paranoia about intruders)  

**Random Event:** Nothing... too quiet. The base should have more undead activity. This silence feels deliberate.  

**Weather Effects:**  
- Fog severity 2/5 reduced visibility to 30 meters  
- Damp conditions caused fungal growths to spread across northern barracks wall  
- Moisture collected 2 units of water from makeshift condensation traps  

**New Developments:**  
- Discovered Iron Vanguard trap (spike strip) near armory  
- Missing medical supplies suggest hostile human activity  
- Fungal Geiger Counter detected new vibration patterns - possible hive expansion beneath motor pool
