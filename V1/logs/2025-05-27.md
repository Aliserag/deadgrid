# Survivor Log - Day 14  

**Location:** The Forgotten Tunnels (Maintenance Depot)  

The flickering emergency lights cast jagged shadows across the damp concrete as I crouched near an abandoned subway car, my reinforced flashlight cutting through the gloom. Last night’s scavenging run was quiet—too quiet. The fungal groves seemed to pulse in the dark, their bioluminescence making the air feel thick with something unnatural.  

I found a stash of food rations tucked beneath a collapsed maintenance cart—enough to last a few more days. But the real prize was a set of tools still wrapped in oilcloth, untouched by rust or rot. My Silent Salvager trait kept my movements hushed, but even so, I could swear I heard something shifting in the deeper tunnels. A wet, dragging sound. Not human.  

The Watchers’ signal still gnaws at me. That flare I saw two nights ago wasn’t just a coincidence. And the radio static? It’s getting worse. Sometimes I catch whispers in the white noise—*"burn the growths"*—like someone’s warning me. Or taunting me.  

The clear weather made moving easier, but the lack of cover meant I had to stick to the shadows. Spring’s dampness clings to everything, making the metal rails slick underfoot. I’m starting to think the fungi react to sound. Every time my boot scuffed concrete, the tendrils seemed to twitch.  

I need to decide: push deeper toward the collapsed tunnel (risky, but the Supply Cache might still hold something), or double back to the Generator Room and see if the Watchers left more than just cryptic radio chatter.

### **Night Action Result: Scavenge**  
- **Found:**  
  - **Food Rations (+3)**  
  - **Tools (Durability: 4)**  
- **Danger:** Low (no encounters, but fungal groves reacted subtly to noise)  
- **Status Effects:**  
  - **Radio Static (duration reduced to 1 day)**  
  - **Fog Anxiety (expired)**  

### **New Discoveries**  
- **Rustvale Urgent Care** added to map (medical supplies potential, but hazardous).  
- **Overgrown Arboretum** now accessible (high-risk, high-reward zone).  

### **Weather Impact**  
- **Clear skies** improved movement speed but forced cautious pathing (no fog meant zombies could spot me easier in open areas).  
- **Spring dampness** made surfaces slippery (-5% stealth near wet tiles).
