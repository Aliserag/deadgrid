# Survivor Log - Day 21  

**Location:** Central Station  
**Weather:** Thick, swirling fog (Visibility: 30ft)  
**Status:** Exhausted but alert  

The fog down here is different. It moves like something alive, curling around the broken escalators and abandoned train cars in slow, deliberate waves. Last night was... unsettling. The fungal patterns on the walls pulsed faintly in the dark, and I swear I heard whispers in the dripping water—not just zombie hive-mind static, but actual *words*. The Fog Dwellers? Maybe.  

Defending the station was a tense affair. Every shadow in the mist looked like movement. The flickering emergency lights played tricks on me, casting long, grasping silhouettes against the concrete. But nothing came. Just the fog, thick and heavy, pressing in like a warning.  

I found fresh markings near the ventilation shaft—crude symbols scraped into the metal, same as the ones the Caravan Collective uses to mark danger zones. But these were different. Angular. Harsh. The Fog Reapers? If they’re real, I don’t want to meet them.  

**Notable Events:**  
- **Fog’s Embrace:** The fungal grove near the Glass Canopy has spread overnight, its bioluminescence dimmed by the fog. My "Fungal Attunement" lets me read the growth patterns—something big passed through here recently. Not zombies. Something *worse*.  
- **Radio Silence:** Scanned frequencies again. Nothing but static. The fog might be interfering, or maybe everyone’s just gone.  
- **Supplies:** Down to two days of water. The pressure cooker can purify more, but I’ll need fuel. The Maintenance Depot might have some, if I’m willing to risk the fog.  

**Plan for Today:**  
1. **Scavenge the Depot:** Need fuel for the cooker. The fog will mask my noise, but it’ll also mask *theirs*.  
2. **Study the Markings:** If the Fog Reapers are nearby, I need to know their patterns.  
3. **Fortify:** If tonight’s as quiet as last night, I’ll take the chance to reinforce the barricades.  

The fog doesn’t just hide things—it *changes* them. I can feel it.

### Game State Updates  
- **Defense Success:** No attacks, but the fog’s psychological toll is real. Base defense holds at 9, but morale dips from tension.  
- **Fog Effects:** -10% to ranged accuracy (visibility), +15% stealth (sound muffling). "Echoes of the Hive" status effect amplifies (-12% sanity instead of -10%).  
- **New Intel:** Fog Reapers' symbols added to map near Ventilation Shaft (hostile territory warning).
