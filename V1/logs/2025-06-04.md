**Survivor Log - Day 18**  

*The storm rages on outside, but down here in the tunnels, it's just the distant rumble of thunder and the occasional drip of water through cracks in the ceiling. The emergency lights flicker like dying fireflies, casting long shadows that seem to move on their own. I swear, sometimes I hear whispers in the dark—not just the infected, but something else. The Watchers? The Iron Vanguard? Whoever they are, they're watching. I can feel it.*  

Last night, I risked scavenging deeper into the Maintenance Depot. The storm masked my movements, but the flooded sections were treacherous. Nearly lost my footing in the dark, my reinforced flashlight cutting through the gloom just enough to spot a half-submerged toolbox. Inside, a miracle: a **map** of the tunnels, marked with old maintenance routes and—more importantly—a path to the **Willowfen Marsh**. If the water's clean there, it could be a game-changer.  

But the storm made everything harder. The howling wind above ground sent vibrations through the tunnels, shaking loose debris. At one point, an entire section of ceiling collapsed near the Flooded Passage, cutting off one of my potential escape routes. The constant thunder made it impossible to tell if the groans I heard were the infected or just the storm playing tricks on me.  

And then there was *them*. The Iron Vanguard. I caught a glimpse of their markings near the Transit Hub—fresh, deliberate. They’re getting bolder. Left a message scrawled in rust: *"Leave or be buried."* Charming.  

The fungal groves seem thicker today, too. The air tastes like damp rot, and the whispers... they’re clearer now. Not just noise. Patterns. **Hive Whisperer**—I didn’t ask for this, but if it keeps me alive, I’ll take it.  

**Tomorrow’s priorities:**  
- Secure clean water from Willowfen Marsh (if the storm breaks).  
- Reinforce the barricades near the Supply Cache.  
- Decide: Do I stay and fight for the tunnels, or cut my losses and find a new hideout?  

The storm’s still raging. I’ll sleep with one eye open tonight.
