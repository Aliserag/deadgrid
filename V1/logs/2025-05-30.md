# Survivor Log - Day 15

**Location:** Central Station (The Forgotten Tunnels)  
**Weather:** Clear skies, unnaturally bright moonlight filtering through cracks in the tunnel ceilings  

---

The signal fire burned brighter than I expected last night. Used some of the fungal growths as fuel - they burn with this eerie blue-green flame that seems to pulse like a heartbeat. No response from anyone, but at least it didn't attract the horde. The Watchers must have seen it though - found fresh boot prints near the Generator Room this morning, arranged in that same strange circular pattern they always leave.

The tunnels feel... different today. That caravan warning about underground growths wasn't lying. I can see thin tendrils of bioluminescent fungi creeping along the walls where there was nothing yesterday. They pulse faintly when I shine my reinforced flashlight on them. Makes me wonder if they're somehow connected to those hive whispers that keep haunting me.

Scavenged the Flooded Passage today - nearly got my foot grabbed by something under the murky water. Came up with a pressure cooker from an abandoned maintenance shed. Could be useful if I can find a clean water source. The spring air is crisp down here, almost refreshing if not for the constant smell of damp rot.

Found a new path south while wading through knee-deep water. Marked two new locations on my map:  
- **Transit Hub** - Looks like an old command center with intact radio equipment  
- **Flooded Passage** - Waterlogged tunnel with suspicious ripples moving against the current  

The clear weather makes movement easier, but I feel exposed whenever I have to surface. That damn radio static keeps playing tricks on me - swore I heard a child's laughter echoing from Tunnel G this afternoon. Probably just the wind through the gorge above us.

Tomorrow I'll try to reach that Transit Hub. If the equipment works, maybe I can finally make proper contact with the Caravan Collective. Assuming the Iron Vanguard hasn't gotten to it first...
