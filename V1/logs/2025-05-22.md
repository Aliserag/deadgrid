# Survivor Log - Day 11

**Location:** Central Station, The Forgotten Tunnels  
**Weather:** Thick fog clinging to every surface  

The emergency lights flicker like dying fireflies as I wake to the sound of distant dripping. That damn transmission keeps replaying in my head - "They're learning!" Learning what? How to turn doorknobs? How to use tools? Christ...

The fog down here is worse than topside - a wet, clinging thing that makes every shadow pulse with imagined movement. My reinforced flashlight barely cuts through it, the beam diffusing into a dull glow after ten feet. Found myself jumping at my own echoes three times before breakfast (if you can call half a protein bar breakfast).

Scavenged the station platforms today. The Silent Salvager perk paid off - managed to pry open an old vending machine without alerting whatever's deeper in the tunnels. Score: two cans of beans (expired 2024, but who's counting?) and a mostly-intact toolkit. The bicycle's cargo basket made hauling everything back easier, though the squeaky wheel nearly gave me a heart attack when the sound echoed down tunnel G.

Speaking of tunnels, I spotted fresh chalk marks near the generator room - Watchers' symbols. They're definitely still active down here. Maybe that signal yesterday was theirs? Couldn't make out the response through the static. 

The fog does strange things to sound. Twice I swore I heard whispering from the collapsed tunnel sector, but when I crept closer, there was just... dripping. And something else. A wet, shuffling sound that wasn't quite footsteps. Didn't stick around to investigate.

Morale's holding, but this place wears on you. The fungi growing on the walls pulses when you're not looking directly at it. Probably just the spores playing tricks in this damn fog...

## Night Action & Event Results
- **Rest:** The relative safety of Central Station allowed for proper sleep (+5 health, -1 food/water)  
- **Fog Effects:** Reduced visibility made scavenging riskier (-2% success chance) but masked small noises  
- **Watcher Activity:** Their chalk symbols appear fresher near Generator Room (new faction clue)  
- **Radio Signals:** Intermittent static bursts suggest someone's trying to communicate on same frequency
