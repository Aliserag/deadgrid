# Survivor Log - Day 41

**Location:** Fort Crimson - Underground Bunker  
**Weather:** The storm howls like a dying beast outside, rain hammering against the bunker hatch with enough force to make me check the seals twice. My fungal Geiger counter keeps crackling - something about this weather excites the spores in the air.  

I spent the night scavenging the armory despite the storm. The military-grade floodlights cut through the rain just enough to create shifting pockets of visibility between the downpour. Found a crate of MREs buried under collapsed shelving - the rats hadn't gotten to them yet. Nearly got my head taken off by a motion-activated turret that still had power though. The damn thing must have shorted in the rain, firing at shadows.  

The fungal whispers are getting louder. I keep seeing flashes in my peripheral vision - figures in tattered military uniforms moving with unnatural coordination. My developing fungal adaptation lets me sense their patrol patterns, but the storm's interference makes it feel like listening to a broken radio.  

Captain Voss showed up at dawn, his circuit-board tattoos glowing faintly under soaked fatigues. Said something about "the perimeter breach at Sector 7" before his mechanical eye shorted out in the rain. The man moves like a ghost - didn't even trigger the turrets. Left me a military field manual with pages that smell like gunpowder and motor oil.  

**Notable Finds:**  
- 12x Military Rations (+3 days food)  
- Functional Motion Sensor (needs repair)  
- Bunker Access Codes (from manual)  

**Storm Effects:**  
- Flooding has started in the eastern tunnels  
- Zombie movements are erratic but slowed by mud  
- Radio communications completely jammed  

**Threat Assessment:**  
The armored zombies are congregating near the command center. They don't like the rain, but the fungal growths on their bodies seem to be... spreading faster? I need to reinforce the bunker entrance before nightfall.
