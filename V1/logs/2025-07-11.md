# Survivor Log - Day 40

**Location:** Fort Crimson - Underground Bunker  
**Weather:** The storm howls outside like a living thing. Rain hammers the reinforced bunker doors with enough force to make the steel groan. Every few minutes, a lightning strike illuminates the compound through the narrow ventilation slits, casting eerie strobe-light glimpses of military zombies shuffling through the flooded courtyard. The fungal veins in my arms throb in time with the thunder.

Spent the night trying to craft makeshift barricades from scrap metal and fungal chitin. The storm made it impossible to work outside - nearly lost three fingers when a gust nearly blew my workbench into the flooded trench where those armored bastards lurk. 

The fungal Geiger counter kept chattering like a demented sous chef, detecting strange pulsations from the carnival grounds to the northwest. That new "Carnival of the Damned" makes my skin crawl even from here - swear I can hear distorted calliope music between thunderclaps.

Gabriel showed up at dusk, dripping with glowing rainwater. The man moves through storms like they're old friends. He left a "gift" - a pressure cooker modified with fungal filtration membranes. "For reducing your sauces properly," he said with that unsettling smile. The thing purifies water frighteningly well, though it makes the liquid glow faintly blue.

No sign of the Iron Vanguard tonight - probably holed up somewhere dry. The military radio picked up their encrypted chatter about "containment protocols" near the transit hub. Meanwhile, the Sporebound left fungal markers by the eastern gate - their version of storm warnings, I think.

**Status:**  
- Morale holding at 15 (the storm's oppressive but the bunker's secure)  
- Food stores critical (0) - living off condensation from the walls  
- Fungal Synchronization making the lightning flashes feel like premonitions  
- Hive excavation vibrations getting stronger through the storm  

Tomorrow's priorities:  
1. Raid the armory if the storm breaks  
2. Decipher those Sporebound markers  
3. Maybe check that damn carnival...  

God, I miss dry socks.
