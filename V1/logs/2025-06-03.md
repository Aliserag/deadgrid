# Survivor Log - Day 17

The storm outside rages like the dead themselves - relentless and hungry. The concrete walls of the Generator Room tremble with each thunderclap, the flickering emergency lights casting jumpy shadows that make me see movement where there is none. The "Echoes of the Hive" don't help - that whispering in the walls has become my constant companion now.

Spent last night working on reinforcing our defenses. The howling wind masked the noise of my hammering, but also meant I couldn't hear approaching threats. Found some old metal grating and wired it across the main entrance - not pretty, but it'll slow down anything trying to get in. The Watchers' markings nearby suggest they might disagree with my renovations though.

That fungal warning from the Caravan Collective has me worried. The mushrooms in these tunnels seem to pulse when the lightning flashes, like they're alive. I swear one moved when I wasn't looking...

The Transit Hub calls to me - might be a way to the surface that avoids the flooded passages. But with this storm, even if I make it up there, visibility will be shit. Might be better to wait it out, though our food won't last forever.

Found a working pressure cooker in the Supply Cache yesterday. If I can find a clean water source, we might finally solve our hydration problems. That is, if the Iron Vanguard hasn't claimed all the good spots already. Their territorial markings around Central Station were... aggressive.

Tomorrow's goals:
1. Scout the Ventilation Shaft - might be a stealth route
2. Boil water if the storm lets up
3. Watch for Watcher activity
4. Try not to go insane from the damn whispering
```

## Night Action + Event Results
- **Crafting**: Successfully reinforced base defenses (+2 base_defense) using scrap metal from abandoned train cars
- **Storm Effects**: 
  - Masked noise from crafting (no zombie attraction)
  - Prevented outdoor movement (flooding in tunnels worsened)
  - Caused minor structural stress (-1 durability to all gear)
- **Random Event (Nothing)**: The night passed without incident, though the storm's intensity made sleep difficult (-5 morale)

## Map Updates
- Ventilation Shaft area now fully mapped (previously obscured by storm debris)
- New fungal growth appears near Transit Hub (marked by Caravan Collective warnings)
