# Survivor Log - Day 16

The storm rages above us, its fury muffled by layers of concrete but still shaking dust from the tunnel ceilings. I spent last night by the flickering emergency lights, working on reinforcing our gear while the rain hammered the surface world. The pressure cooker proved invaluable - managed to purify some of the standing water that's been seeping through the cracks.

**Crafting Results:**
- Repaired the reinforced flashlight (durability +1)
- Used scrap metal to reinforce the vest (durability +1)
- Created makeshift water collectors from abandoned train parts (+2 water next collection)

The fungal growths seem... agitated today. They pulse in time with the thunder, glowing faintly when the lights flicker. I keep hearing whispers in the tunnels that don't match the storm's rhythm. The Watchers left another marking near the generator room - three slashes in yellow paint. Warning or invitation?

**New Discoveries:**
- Found an axe buried in fungal growth near the Glass Canopy (added to gear)
- Spotted movement near Central Station - not infected. The new faction makes me nervous. Their territory markings are crude but deliberate.

**Weather Impact:**
The storm makes everything harder. Scavenging parties report:
- Visibility near zero in open areas
- Strange currents in the flooded passages
- Radio signals completely jammed
- But the rain masks our noise from the hordes

I've ordered everyone to stay in the central tunnels today. The Last Stop Camp survivors might be our best chance at weathering this storm, but their territorial claims complicate things. That axe won't be much use if this turns into Tunnel Wars.
