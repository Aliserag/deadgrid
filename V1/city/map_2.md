# Fungal Overgrowth District

A once-bustling commercial block now consumed by pulsating fungal growths. The skeletal remains of storefronts peek through veils of bioluminescent tendrils. Underground tunnels breathe beneath cracked pavement, their metallic groans echoing through the ruins. The air hums with dangerous spores that cling to every surface.
