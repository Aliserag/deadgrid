# Carnival of the Damned

Once a vibrant amusement park, now a decaying playground for the infected. The rusting roller coasters loom like skeletal remains, while fungal growths pulsate through the ticket booths. The carnival games now serve as macabre traps, and the Ferris wheel creaks ominously in the wind. Survivors whisper about something unnatural lurking in the funhouse mirrors.
