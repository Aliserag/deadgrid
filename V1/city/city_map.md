# Fort Crimson

A partially overrun military outpost that once served as a regional command center. The outer perimeter is compromised, but the armory and underground bunker may still hold valuable supplies. Bloodstains and spent shell casings suggest a last stand occurred here. The base's floodlights still flicker intermittently, casting eerie shadows across the compound.
