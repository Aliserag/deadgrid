# Survivor Log - Day 14

**Location:** The Forgotten Tunnels - Park Maintenance Shed  
**Weather:** The clear spring air carries an unsettling stillness through the tunnels. Without rain or fog, every sound echoes twice as loud. I can hear water dripping somewhere in the distance - or is that just the Radio Static playing tricks on me again?

Defended the shed all night. Boarded up the windows with scrap metal from the depot, set up tripwires with empty cans. Thought I heard something moving beyond the fungal grove around 3 AM - not the shuffling of infected, but something... purposeful. The Watchers? Or maybe that new faction - the Iron Vanguard? Their radio discipline would explain why I only caught fragments.

The whispers are getting worse. When I close my eyes, I see flashes of the hive mind - a thousand rotting mouths moving in unison. Found myself humming along to their rhythm this morning before I caught myself. Need to find medical supplies soon before this Echoes of the Hive thing gets worse.

Scavenged the Maintenance Depot during daylight. Found:
- 3 food rations (expired but edible)
- A working pressure cooker (could boil water if I find a clean source)
- Military-grade boot prints near the generator room. Too organized to be raiders.

**New Discovery:** The Glass Canopy above the Park section is still intact. Sunlight filters through decades of grime, making the fungal growths glow an eerie blue. Might be able to grow something here if I can clear out the spores.

**Status Update:**  
- Fog Anxiety finally lifted  
- Radio Static persists (hearing phantom Morse code in the dripping pipes)  
- New skill potential noticed: The hive whispers might help predict zombie movements if I can endure them  

Need to decide: Push deeper toward the Collapsed Tunnel tomorrow or try signaling the Caravan Collective again. That last transmission about "burning the growths" has me worried - what do they know about these fungi?
