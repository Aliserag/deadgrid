# Survivor Log - Day 12

**Location:** Central Station, Forgotten Tunnels  
**Weather:** Thick fog clings to everything like a shroud  

The generators hummed all night as we reinforced the barricades. That eerie quiet still hasn't broken - no scratching at the doors, no distant moans. Just the drip-drip of condensation and the occasional creak of ancient metal. It's more unsettling than a horde at this point.

The fog seeped in through every crack this morning, turning our flashlight beams into hazy cones that barely pierced ten feet. I nearly walked right past a supply crate because of it - just a dark shape looming suddenly from the mist. Found some decent salvage though:  
- 3 cans of beans (expiration dates long gone, but what isn't?)  
- A roll of duct tape (gold in these times)  
- Half a dozen AA batteries (miraculously still holding charge)  

Caught fresh Watcher markings near the generator room - three vertical slashes in blue paint. Same color they used at the tool factory. Either they're expanding territory or marking something. Neither option sits right with me.  

That hospital transmission keeps playing in my head. Could be survivors. Could be a trap. Could be nothing but dead air and ghosts. But with the tunnels this quiet... maybe it's time to risk the surface.  

**Status:**  
- Health holding steady (that fungal infection seems to be clearing)  
- Morale low (this silence is worse than gunfire)  
- Food situation improved but still precarious  

Going to scout the maintenance depot today if the fog lifts. Need tools more than anything now - these barricades won't hold forever.

## Night Action Results  
**Defense Successful:** The reinforced barricades held through the unnaturally quiet night. The fog seems to be dampening zombie activity as well, with only distant, disoriented shuffles heard at the perimeter.  

**Fog Effects:**  
- Reduced visibility made night watch tense but uneventful  
- Dampened sounds prevented detection but also masked approaching threats  
- "Fog Anxiety" status persists (-5% perception)  

**New Developments:**  
- Watcher markings appear fresher near Generator Room  
- Fungi growth has expanded overnight (new bioluminescent patches noted)  
- One emergency light failed permanently (reduced visibility in Sector 3)

## Updated Map  
No new tiles explored due to heavy fog. Maintenance Depot remains priority target.
