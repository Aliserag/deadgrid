# Survivor Log - Day 5

**Entry:**  
The flashlight flickered as I climbed onto the roof last night, signaling into the void with desperate SOS patterns. My arms ached holding it steady for hours, watching the beam cut through the polluted haze. No response. Just the distant moans answering back from the ruined cityscape.  

Dawn revealed nothing changed - no friendly signals, no new hordes drawn to my position. The silence is almost worse than an attack. At least then I'd know I'm not alone in this hell.  

The supply cache near base is running low. That canned food won't last forever, and the water purification tablets are dwindling. Maybe tomorrow I'll risk venturing further down the eastern path. The barricade held through another night, but the nails are starting to pull loose from the doorframe.  

I keep telling myself someone must be out there. The alternative is unthinkable.
