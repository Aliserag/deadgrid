# Survivor Log - Day 3

The flashlight beam cuts through the abandoned streets like a knife through rotten flesh. I moved carefully tonight, retracing my steps to that supply cache we spotted yesterday. Every shadow could be hiding teeth.

Found some decent loot - canned goods that haven't bulged yet, and thank god, bottled water. The plastic crinkled like music when I stuffed them in my pack. Nearly shit myself when a metal shelf collapsed in the back room though. Stood frozen for five minutes waiting for the moans... but nothing came. Maybe this neighborhood's still quiet.

Base is holding. That barricade I built from scrap metal and old furniture actually feels like it might stop something. Found some nails and wire too - could reinforce it tomorrow if I'm feeling brave. 

Gotta ration this food carefully. That gnawing hunger makes it hard to sleep, but waking up dead would be worse.
