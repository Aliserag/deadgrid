# Survivor Log - Day 6

**The Watchtower Incident**

Last night was anything but quiet. I spent hours reinforcing our barricades with scrap metal when the flashlight beam caught movement beyond our perimeter. Not zombies - human shapes moving with purpose through the ruined buildings to the east.

I froze, watching as they methodically cleared a path through the debris. Military? Raiders? They had rifles slung across their backs but moved like scavengers, not soldiers. One stopped suddenly, staring right at our position. I killed the light and held my breath.

They vanished into the urban maze before dawn, but not before marking the walls with chalk symbols - a crude eye inside a triangle. Whatever faction this is, they're organized. And now they know we're here.

The barricade held through the night, but I found fresh scratches on the metal this morning. The dead are getting bolder. We'll need better defenses if we're staying here.
