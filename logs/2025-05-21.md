# Survivor Log - Day 7  

**The Night Watch**  

The barricade held. I spent the night listening to the groans outside, tightening the makeshift defenses with what little metal and fabric I had. Around 3 AM, I heard scratching at the eastern wall - something was testing the perimeter. I held my breath, flashlight clenched like a weapon... but they moved on.  

At dawn, I found my gear in better shape than expected. That old flashlight? The casing's reinforced now - must have happened when I was banging it against the barricade supports. It's sturdier, throws a brighter beam too. Small blessings.  

The Watchers left another mark near the supply cache - three chalk lines on the pavement. They're watching me scavenge. Not sure if that's a warning or an invitation.  

**Status Update:**  
- Reinforced barricade (+1 base_defense)  
- Upgraded flashlight (now "reinforced flashlight" with +2 durability)  
- Watchers seem more active to the east
