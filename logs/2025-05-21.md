# Survivor Log - Day 2

**The First Night Watch**  

I spent the night reinforcing our pathetic excuse for a barricade with whatever scrap metal I could find. Every creak of the building made my heart race - was that just the wind, or something worse? The flashlight's beam barely cut through the darkness as I worked, my hands shaking as I twisted wires around the doorframe.  

By dawn, my fingers were raw but we'd doubled our defenses. The night passed without incident - no scratching at the walls, no distant screams. Either we're in a quiet zone, or the dead haven't found us yet. That supply cache down the street keeps calling to me... maybe today's the day I risk a quick scavenge.  

(Added +1 base_defense from night fortifications)
