# Survivor Log - Day 8  

**Weather:** Clear skies, mild breeze. The kind of day that makes you forget the world ended—until you hear the distant moans.  

---  

Last night I risked signaling again, flashing my reinforced flashlight toward the east where I last saw the Watchers. No response. Just the empty silence of the apocalypse. I swear I saw movement in the ruins beyond, but nothing came of it. Maybe they're watching. Maybe I'm just paranoid.  

The morning sun revealed something new—a patchwork banner fluttering in the distance. **The Caravan Collective.** Traders, if the rumors are true. Neutral, but only as long as you have something they want. I don’t have much to barter, but if they’re passing through, it might be worth tracking them down before they move on.  

On my way back to base, I stumbled across an **abandoned Mega Mart.** The automatic doors are stuck open, half-buried under collapsed shelving. The stench of rot and something worse lingers in the air. Could be supplies inside. Could be a death trap.  

Found a **vest** near the entrance—sturdy, but smells like old sweat. Better than nothing.  

The clear weather makes movement easier, but I feel exposed. No rain means no cover, and the undead don’t squint in the sunlight like I do. Still, it’s better than slogging through mud.  

**Plan for today:**  
- Scavenge the Mega Mart (carefully).  
- Maybe track down the Caravan before they vanish.  
- Pray the Watchers don’t decide I’m a threat.  

Stay alive.
