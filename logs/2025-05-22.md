# Day 1: First Contact

The dead started walking three days ago. I've been holed up in my apartment ever since, watching the city turn to chaos through broken windows and the screams outside. Electricity went out yesterday. Water this morning. 

I decided to venture out today, just to the corner store. No food left, and thirst can kill you faster than those things out there. I grabbed what I could - a few bottles of water, some canned food, and a heavy flashlight that might double as a weapon in a pinch.

On the way back, I spotted a group of people barricading the entrance to the old factory building a few blocks north. They seemed organized, cautious. I should check them out tomorrow if I get the chance. Strength in numbers, right?

The street near my building is clear for now. I've set up a barricade at my door using the bookshelf and some furniture. It won't hold against a determined group, but it might buy me some time.

My plan tomorrow is to scavenge the abandoned cars along the street. Someone might have left something useful.

As night falls, the growling outside gets louder. I keep the lights off, huddled in the dark. The north barricade held. But for how long?
