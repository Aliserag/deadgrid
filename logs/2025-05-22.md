# Survivor Log - Day 10

**The Fog Plays Tricks**  

The thick spring fog clung to everything this morning like a wet shroud. I could barely see past the barricade when I went to check the perimeter. The reinforced flashlight helped, but even its boosted beam just created a glowing tunnel in the soupy air.  

Last night I tried signaling from the roof - flashing my light in SOS patterns toward where I last saw Watcher activity. No response except the occasional distant moan that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere in the fog.  

Found something strange near Rustbelt Tool & Die today. The factory's metal dust coating made my footprints vanish almost instantly. Creepy as hell, but useful. The place is picked clean except for some heavy machinery that'd take a team to move. That's when I heard it - a burst of static from an old intercom system, then a voice:  

*"They're learning! Don't let them—"* followed by screams and what sounded like... chewing? Transmission cut out before I could pinpoint the source.  

The Caravan Collective's markings are fresh on the southern route. Might be worth risking contact soon. My supplies won't last forever.  

**Status Update:**  
- Food running low (4 days left)  
- Water situation critical (2 days left)  
- That vest I found is holding up surprisingly well  
- The bicycle makes scavenging runs easier, but the squeaky chain needs oil  

The fog's playing hell with my nerves. Every shadow looks like a shambler until you're three feet away. Tomorrow I'll—  

*[sound of metal creaking in distance]*  

Did... did the factory door just move?

## Night Action + Event Results  

**Signaling Attempt:**  
The flashing lights attracted no survivors, but you're certain you saw answering flashes from the eastern industrial district before the fog swallowed them. The Watchers are definitely out there.  

**Random Event (Nothing):**  
An unsettling quiet persists. The usual nighttime moans and scrapes were absent, making sleep difficult despite the exhaustion. The fog seems to be dampening sound as well as visibility.  

**Weather Impact:**  
- Visibility reduced to 2 tiles  
- All sound-based detection (zombie or survivor) suffers -15% effectiveness  
- Metal surfaces stay damp, accelerating rust on unprotected gear
