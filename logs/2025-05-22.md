# Survivor Log - Day 10

**Clear skies, strange calm**

The morning light cut through our boarded-up windows like a knife through butter. After last night's tense watch shift, I expected at least some zombie activity, but the streets remained eerily quiet. Too quiet. The Watchers' increased activity to the east has me on edge - are they preparing something, or just as spooked by this unnatural silence as I am?

Spent the morning reinforcing our barricades with the last of our fabric scraps. That vest I found last week came in handy - tore some strips to reinforce the weak points. The clear weather made the work easier, though the bright sun made every shadow in the unexplored areas of the subdivision look like potential threats.

Found a pristine first-aid bandage while checking our perimeter! Must have fallen from someone's pack during the initial outbreak. With our supplies running low, this feels like a small miracle.

Late afternoon brought an unexpected visitor - Dr. Elias Vance from the Caravan Collective. The man moves like a ghost, appearing at our southern barricade without triggering a single noise alarm. His calm demeanor was almost unsettling given the circumstances. Offered to trade medical knowledge for information about the Watchers' movements. I played dumb - no sense choosing sides yet.

The Salvage Bicycle's extra storage proved invaluable today. Managed to stash some extra supplies from the nearby cache without attracting attention. That Silent Salvager trait is paying off - I can practically hear the zombies breathing from three blocks away now.

Tomorrow I'll need to risk venturing further east. The supply cache won't last forever, and with the Watchers active in that direction... well, let's just say I'm sleeping with my flashlight in hand tonight.
