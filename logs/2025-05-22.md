# Survivor Log - Day 9

**Location:** Home Base  
**Weather:** Clear skies, moderate temperature  

The Watchers were active again last night - saw their signal fires burning to the east. I don't know whether to be comforted or terrified by their increased activity. The Caravan Collective's scouts passed through the southern district too, though they kept their distance. This city is getting crowded with the living, and that might be more dangerous than the dead.

Took advantage of the clear weather to scavenge Sunset Ridge Subdivision. The spring air carried the scent of blooming flowers mixed with... less pleasant things. Found an abandoned bicycle with a milk crate still attached - perfect for hauling supplies. The subdivision was eerily quiet except for wind chimes tinkling in the breeze, each note making my skin crawl as I imagined it drawing attention.

Learned something important today - how to move quietly through these ruins. Started practicing what I'm calling "Silent Salvaging" techniques. Slower going, but I didn't attract a single shambler despite prying open three different garage doors.

## Night Action Results
The scavenging run to Sunset Ridge yielded:
- **+2 Food** (canned goods from a pantry)
- **+1 Water** (bottled water from garage)
- **+1 Fabric** (from curtains in a living room)

The clear weather made movement easier but left me exposed - had to abandon one house when I spotted a group of infected through the picture window. My new silent techniques kept me from alerting them.
