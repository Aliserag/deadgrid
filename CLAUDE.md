# DeadGrid - Post-Apocalyptic Zombie Survival Game

## üéÆ Game Overview
DeadGrid is a turn-based zombie survival game with procedural generation, base building, and dark post-apocalyptic aesthetics inspired by "This War of Mine". Players navigate through a desolate world, manage resources, build camps, interact with NPCs, and survive against increasingly difficult zombie threats.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.2 with TypeScript
- **Game Engine**: Phaser 3 (best for AI-generated content and procedural generation)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **AI**: DeepSeek API for procedural content generation
- **Backend**: Python scripts for AI-driven events
- **Future**: Chainlink VRF for randomness, NFT characters

## üéØ Core Game Modes

### 1. Solo Mode (Exploration)
- **Turn-based movement** on a procedurally generated map
- **Visibility system**: Fog of war reveals areas as you explore
- **Zombie spawning**: 
  - Single zombies (common)
  - Zombie groups (uncommon) 
  - Zombie hordes/swarms (rare)
- **Detection mechanics**: Distance-based probability of zombie detection
- **Resource scavenging**: Search buildings and locations for loot

### 2. Camp Mode (Base Building)
- **Two camp types**:
  - Open/Forest camps (easier to flee, lower defense)
  - Building camps (harder to flee, higher defense)
- **Base development**: Progressive upgrades and fortifications
- **Siege mechanics**: Defend against zombie attacks
- **Resource management**: Food, water, medicine, ammunition, materials
- **NPC recruitment**: Build a community of survivors

## üßü Zombie Mechanics

### Types
1. **Walker** (Single)
   - Health: 20 HP
   - Speed: Slow
   - Damage: 5-10
   - Detection range: 3 tiles
   - Loot: Common items

2. **Runner Group** (2-5 zombies)
   - Health: 15 HP each

   - Detection range: 5 tiles
   - Loot: Uncommon items

3. **Horde** (10+ zombies)
   - Health: 10 HP each
   - Speed: Variable
   - Damage: 5-8 each

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat System

### Melee Combat
- **Range**: Adjacent tile only
- **Damage**: 10-20 + weapon modifier
- **Stamina cost**: 10
- **Noise level**: Low

### Ranged Combat
- **Range**: Based on weapon (pistol: 5 tiles, rifle: 8 tiles)
- **Damage**: 15-30 + weapon modifier
- **Ammo consumption**: 1-3 per shot
- **Noise level**: High (attracts zombies)

### Damage Calculation
```javascript
damage = baseDamage + random(-5, 5) + weaponModifier + skillModifier
criticalChance = 0.1 + luckModifier
if (critical) damage *= 2
```

## üë• NPC System

2. **Raiders** - Hostile, steal resources
3. **Traders** - Neutral, offer trades
4. **Cannibals** - Hostile, disguised as friendly
5. **Military Remnants** - Organized, territorial
6. **Cultists** - Unpredictable behavior

### NPC Behaviors
- **Friendly** (30%): Will trade, may join camp
- **Neutral** (50%): Ignore unless provoked

### NPC Stats
- Health: 50-100 HP
- Skills: Combat, Medical, Engineering, Scavenging

## üéØ Design Principles
1. **Atmosphere First**: Every decision should enhance the dark, hopeless atmosphere
2. **Meaningful Choices**: No choice should be obviously correct
3. **Emergent Storytelling**: Let player actions create unique narratives
4. **Resource Scarcity**: Everything should feel valuable
5. **Permadeath Stakes**: Make every turn count

## üéÆ Game Controls

### Movement
- **Arrow Keys / WASD**: Move player on grid
- **Space**: End turn

### Combat
- **Click on adjacent enemy**: Melee attack
- **G**: Ranged attack (requires ammo, auto-targets nearest enemy within 5 tiles)

### Interaction
- **E**: Pickup loot at current position
- **C**: Establish camp (when safe, no enemies within 3 tiles)
- **Click on NPC**: Interact (trade with friendly, attack hostile)

### Game Features
- **Three zombie types**: Single (common), Groups (uncommon), Swarms (rare)
- **Distance-based detection**: Zombies more likely to detect you when closer
- **Six NPC factions**: Each with different behaviors and items
- **Base building**: 8 structure types with resource management
- **Procedural events**: Daily generated events with meaningful choices
- **Death mechanics**: NPCs turn into zombies when killed
